74966|0x005D80CD|Whenever she tells someone she's asked me something and I don't~answer, that means that she hasn't asked me anything in the first~place.

74994|0x005D8A91|If the person you enter into a relationship with is someone I deeply~care for as well, that would also bring the two of us closer...

75001|0x005D8CF4|What's your answer?
75002|0x005D8D21|...Well, that isn't something only I get to decide.
75003|0x005D8D5F|...Well, that isn't something~only I get to decide.
75004|0x005D8DBC|I think it quite is.
75005|0x005D8DDB|I think it quite is.
75006|0x005D8E09|When it comes to romantic relationships, the feelings of both parties~matter, no?
75007|0x005D8E65|When it comes to romantic~relationships, the feelings of~both parties matter, no?
75008|0x005D8ED2|Which is exactly why I said that it depends on you.
75009|0x005D8F10|Which is exactly why I said~that it depends on you.
75010|0x005D8F59|Kosame-san put up her index finger and declared, triumphantly so.
75011|0x005D8FA5|Kosame-san put up her index~finger and declared,~triumphantly so.
75012|0x005D9002|The odds are in your favor.
75013|0x005D9028|The odds are in your favor.
75014|0x005D906D|It's her younger twin sister saying so, so there's no doubt about it.
75015|0x005D90BD|It's her younger twin sister~saying so, so there's no doubt~about it.
75016|0x005D915C|After school, we went over what we learned about Hisakaki's meteorite~from Mayaka-san yesterday.
75017|0x005D91C7|After school, we went over what~we learned about Hisakaki's~meteorite from Mayaka-san~yesterday.
75018|0x005D9270|At lunch break, Asuho had already gotten to the fairy tales that she~loved most.
75019|0x005D92CB|At lunch break, Asuho had~already gotten to the fairy~tales that she loved most.
75020|0x005D9368|I imagine the meteorite from fifty-six years ago must have looked like~a shooting star to Hibarigasaki's townspeople.

75022|0x005D9477|Yeah, I bet some people probably even made wishes.
75023|0x005D94B4|Yeah, I bet some people~probably even made wishes.
75024|0x005D952B|Though they might not have had the time to do so. I would think they~were all really surprised because of how bright it was.

75026|0x005D967E|It was a fireball, after all.
75027|0x005D96A6|It was a fireball, after all.
75028|0x005D9707|...A ball of fire?
75029|0x005D9724|...A ball of fire?
75030|0x005D9760|Ah, no. Fireball is just a term they use to describe meteors that are~a lot brighter than usual.
75031|0x005D97CB|Ah, no. Fireball is just a term~they use to describe meteors~that are a lot brighter than~usual.
75032|0x005D9881|These shooting stars and fireballs we talk about are tiny pieces of~debris that travel in our solar system.
75033|0x005D98F7|These shooting stars and~fireballs we talk about are~tiny pieces of debris that~travel in our solar system.
75034|0x005D997E|They plunge into our atmosphere at extremely high velocities around~dozens of kilometers per second, and flare up through the extreme~friction they sustain.
75035|0x005D9A25|They plunge into our atmosphere~at extremely high velocities~around dozens of kilometers per~second, and flare up through
75036|0x005D9AC8|Shooting stars shine until an altitude of around 100 kilometers from~Earth, while fireballs still shine an extra fifty kilometers beyond~that.

75038|0x005D9BFB|Normally, they disintegrate entirely while still in the atmosphere,~but sometimes you get ones that reach the ground before fully~disintegrating.
75039|0x005D9C97|Normally, they disintegrate~entirely while still in the~atmosphere, but sometimes you~get ones that reach the ground
75040|0x005D9D35|Those are what we call meteorites.
75041|0x005D9D62|Those are what we call~meteorites.
75042|0x005D9D9E|Oh, I see. So that means meteorites are originally pieces of space~debris.
75043|0x005D9DF3|Oh, I see. So that means~meteorites are originally~pieces of space debris.
75044|0x005D9E82|So where do those pieces of debris originate from?
75045|0x005D9EBF|So where do those pieces of~debris originate from?
75046|0x005D9F40|You can think of normal shootings stars as kinda like debris left~behind by something like Halley's comet.
75047|0x005D9FB5|You can think of normal~shootings stars as kinda like~debris left behind by something~like Halley's comet.
75048|0x005DA049|Bigger ones like fireballs and meteorites are thought to originate~from the asteroids that orbit near Jupiter and Mars in the asteroid~belt. I guess you could think of 'em like fragments or pieces from~those.
75049|0x005DA124|Bigger ones like fireballs and~meteorites are thought to~originate from the asteroids~that orbit near Jupiter and
75050|0x005DA1EB|They say there might also be meteorites that originate from stars far~outside our own solar system.
75051|0x005DA259|They say there might also be~meteorites that originate from~stars far outside our own solar~system.
75052|0x005DA301|That certainly captures your imagination.
75053|0x005DA335|That certainly captures your~imagination.
75054|0x005DA3B6|Totally. I mean, meteorites are the only things from space except~rocks from the moon that we can touch with our own hands.
75055|0x005DA43C|Totally. I mean, meteorites are~the only things from space~except rocks from the moon that~we can touch with our own
75056|0x005DA4C0|While we can see the stars by gazing through a telescope, we can't~touch them.
75057|0x005DA519|While we can see the stars by~gazing through a telescope, we~can't touch them.
75058|0x005DA591|It's the sole way we have to communicate with the stars.
75059|0x005DA5D4|It's the sole way we have to~communicate with the stars.
75060|0x005DA651|...Like messages from the August Star of Heaven?
75061|0x005DA68C|...Like messages from the~August Star of Heaven?
75062|0x005DA6E6|That's the idea!
75063|0x005DA701|That's the idea!
75064|0x005DA73B|Like curses from a vile god?
75065|0x005DA762|Like curses from a vile god?
75066|0x005DA7BF|Come on, Aoi-san! Get away from that evil version already!
75067|0x005DA804|Come on, Aoi-san! Get away from~that evil version already!
75068|0x005DA868|I want to go with that version all the way.
75069|0x005DA89E|I want to go with that version~all the way.
75070|0x005DA8E3|At any rate, what she means is that meteorites give us clues that let~us learn more about celestial bodies.
75071|0x005DA959|At any rate, what she means is~that meteorites give us clues~that let us learn more about~celestial bodies.
75072|0x005DAA20|Though, in reality, the number of people that get to communicate with~those meteorites is terribly small.
75073|0x005DAA94|Though, in reality, the number~of people that get to~communicate with those~meteorites is terribly small.
75074|0x005DAB19|At present, the total number of meteorites that have been discovered~across Japan sits at a mere fifty.
75075|0x005DAB8B|At present, the total number of~meteorites that have been~discovered across Japan sits at~a mere fifty.
75076|0x005DAC37|I think there'd be more if you count all the ones that haven't been~found, but yeah, they're still super rare.
75077|0x005DACB0|I think there'd be more if you~count all the ones that haven't~been found, but yeah, they're~still super rare.
75078|0x005DAD48|It's said that out of all the stones that are thought to be meteorites~and get appraised, only one of every 1,000 turns out to really be one.
75079|0x005DADE0|It's said that out of all the~stones that are thought to be~meteorites and get appraised,~only one of every 1,000 turns
75080|0x005DAE67|I guess that makes the town of Hibarigasaki a pretty special place,~considering the fact that we had two meteorites come down here.

75082|0x005DAFB4|As explained, meteorites are already rare enough, but there's an even~rarer subset.
75083|0x005DB012|As explained, meteorites are~already rare enough, but~there's an even rarer subset.
75084|0x005DB08F|That is iron meteorites. Unlike normal meteorites that are stony,~these are meteorites that have traces of iron, too.
75085|0x005DB10F|That is iron meteorites. Unlike~normal meteorites that are~stony, these are meteorites~that have traces of iron, too.
75086|0x005DB1D4|If those are even rarer than normal meteorites, I'd guess you'd really~have to be lucky to see one of those.
75087|0x005DB24B|If those are even rarer than~normal meteorites, I'd guess~you'd really have to be lucky~to see one of those.
75088|0x005DB302|...I feel like I would like to see one at least once.

75096|0x005DB72C|This naginata, this relic forged from meteoric iron, gives witness to~that fact.

75376|0x005E0B23|Are you talking about a dream you see when you sleep?
75377|0x005E0B63|Are you talking about a dream~you see when you sleep?
75378|0x005E0BB2|Yeah.
75379|0x005E0BC2|Yeah.
75380|0x005E0BEF|There's no telling until I actually do it. It seems like the~nightmares I reap aren't limited to the nightmares people have when~sleeping.
75381|0x005E0C84|There's no telling until I~actually do it. It seems like~the nightmares I reap aren't~limited to the nightmares
75382|0x005E0D3A|...This whole thing is making me scared. What if something entirely~different gets reaped instead?
75383|0x005E0DA7|...This whole thing is making~me scared. What if something~entirely different gets reaped~instead?
75384|0x005E0E66|Let's say Hisakaki asked you to reap that nightmare, would it then~come to you reaping that specific nightmare?
75385|0x005E0EE0|Let's say Hisakaki asked you to~reap that nightmare, would it~then come to you reaping that~specific nightmare?
75386|0x005E0F77|Let me ask you in return. Is it because you wished for me to reap that~memory that it was reaped?
75387|0x005E0FE3|Let me ask you in return. Is it~because you wished for me to~reap that memory that it was~reaped?
75388|0x005E105E|...Definitely not.
75389|0x005E107B|...Definitely not.
75390|0x005E10B5|Guess that means the answer is no.
75391|0x005E10E2|Guess that means the answer is~no.
75392|0x005E1114|Judging by what she said so far, there actually did seem to be~significant risk involved if we went through with it.
75393|0x005E1193|Judging by what she said so~far, there actually did seem to~be significant risk involved if~we went through with it.
75394|0x005E1265|Kogasaka-kun, that's enough. Let's give up on having her help.
75395|0x005E12AE|Kogasaka-kun, that's enough.~Let's give up on having her~help.
75396|0x005E1306|Um, but...
75397|0x005E131B|Um, but...
75398|0x005E134F|Even if she can't help me, I can still count on you helping me, right?
75399|0x005E13A0|Even if she can't help me, I~can still count on you helping~me, right?
75400|0x005E1404|After saying so, she turned to the side.
75401|0x005E1437|After saying so, she turned to~the side.
75402|0x005E14BC|...I got a queasy feeling in my chest seeing her attitude just now.
75403|0x005E150A|...I got a queasy feeling in my~chest seeing her attitude just~now.
75404|0x005E1567|Why's that?
75405|0x005E157D|Why's that?
75406|0x005E15B0|I don't really get it myself.
75407|0x005E15D8|I don't really get it myself.
75408|0x005E1659|BAAW!
75409|0x005E166A|BAAW!
75410|0x005E16AF|HOT! HOT! HOT!!

75414|0x005E178B|And why is the brunt of it directed at me?!

75416|0x005E183D|Beats me.
75417|0x005E1851|Beats me.
75418|0x005E186A|Mare turned away as well.
75419|0x005E188E|Mare turned away as well.
75420|0x005E18C1|...Yeah, see, there actually is something else I'd like to ask you.
75421|0x005E190F|...Yeah, see, there actually is~something else I'd like to ask~you.
75422|0x005E1962|I collected myself.
75423|0x005E1980|I collected myself.
75424|0x005E19B3|You said you've reaped someone else's nightmare besides mine in the~past, right?
75425|0x005E1A0E|You said you've reaped someone~else's nightmare besides mine~in the past, right?
75426|0x005E1A86|Yep. Mokomoko's nightmare.
75427|0x005E1AAB|Yep. Mokomoko's nightmare.
75428|0x005E1B18|...Fine, whatever. Just keep calling me Mokomoko for all I care.
75429|0x005E1B63|...Fine, whatever. Just keep~calling me Mokomoko for all I~care.
75430|0x005E1BBD|But there's also a chance it was Kosame-san, right?
75431|0x005E1BFB|But there's also a chance it~was Kosame-san, right?
75432|0x005E1C64|Those two are twins, you said? I didn't ask her for her name when I~reaped it, so I only know it's one of the two.
75433|0x005E1CE1|Those two are twins, you said?~I didn't ask her for her name~when I reaped it, so I only~know it's one of the two.
75434|0x005E1D89|Was it here at the lookout?
75435|0x005E1DAF|Was it here at the lookout?
75436|0x005E1DF2|Yep.
75437|0x005E1E01|Yep.
75438|0x005E1E1F|Why did you do it?
75439|0x005E1E3C|Why did you do it?
75440|0x005E1E76|Blade testing.
75441|0x005E1E8F|Blade testing.
75442|0x005E1EB7|...Wh-What?
75443|0x005E1ECD|...Wh-What?
75444|0x005E1F00|Sorry, that was a mistake. I meant reap testing.
75445|0x005E1F3B|Sorry, that was a mistake. I~meant reap testing.
75446|0x005E1FB2|She sounds like some psychopath...
75447|0x005E1FDF|She sounds like some~psychopath...
75448|0x005E2011|Hisakaki said she didn't remember having been reaped. I suppose it was~because of that that she could sit there with that face of~exasperation as if it didn't concern her, rather than getting angry.
75449|0x005E20E2|Hisakaki said she didn't~remember having been reaped. I~suppose it was because of that~that she could sit there with
75450|0x005E218C|And why did you do that?
75451|0x005E21AF|And why did you do that?
75452|0x005E21EF|At the time, I made a promise to reap a nightmare, but I had actually~never reaped one before.
75453|0x005E2258|At the time, I made a promise~to reap a nightmare, but I had~actually never reaped one~before.
75454|0x005E22D0|So I wanted to give it a try once so that I wouldn't fail when the~time came to fulfill my promise.
75455|0x005E233E|So I wanted to give it a try~once so that I wouldn't fail~when the time came to fulfill~my promise.
75456|0x005E23C9|And that's when I found a little girl crying here at the lookout.
75457|0x005E2415|And that's when I found a~little girl crying here at the~lookout.
75458|0x005E247E|Seeing how much pain she seemed to be in, I thought she must have a~nightmare.
75459|0x005E24D7|Seeing how much pain she seemed~to be in, I thought she must~have a nightmare.
75460|0x005E254D|After that, I went and reaped her nightmare...
75461|0x005E2586|After that, I went and reaped~her nightmare...
75462|0x005E25DC|And, for some reason, it was hard on me too.
75463|0x005E2613|And, for some reason, it was~hard on me too.
75464|0x005E264F|Mare got huffy.
75465|0x005E2669|Mare got huffy.
75466|0x005E26A0|...Since then, I made up my mind that I wouldn't reap people's~nightmares while they're actually recalling them.
75467|0x005E271B|...Since then, I made up my~mind that I wouldn't reap~people's nightmares while~they're actually recalling
75468|0x005E27AD|I don't want to experience that awful feeling ever again.
75469|0x005E27F1|I don't want to experience that~awful feeling ever again.
75470|0x005E283A|Sulking, she finished off her explanation with that.
75471|0x005E2879|Sulking, she finished off her~explanation with that.
75472|0x005E28BD|When she reaped my nightmare, she was crying.
75473|0x005E28F5|When she reaped my nightmare,~she was crying.
75474|0x005E2932|Just like it was painful for me to forget the lookout girl's name, it~was painful for her.
75475|0x005E2997|Just like it was painful for me~to forget the lookout girl's~name, it was painful for her.
75476|0x005E2A0B|Have you reaped anyone's nightmare after that?
75477|0x005E2A44|Have you reaped anyone's~nightmare after that?
75478|0x005E2A9A|You were the second one.
75479|0x005E2ABD|You were the second one.
75480|0x005E2AEF|And that's all?
75481|0x005E2B09|And that's all?
75482|0x005E2B32|Yeah.
75483|0x005E2B42|Yeah.
75484|0x005E2B8E|...The way I see it, that means unless the person in question is~actively recalling their nightmare, you can't judge whether or not~they have one. Is that correct?
75485|0x005E2C3C|...The way I see it, that means~unless the person in question~is actively recalling their~nightmare, you can't judge
75486|0x005E2CD8|While I can't say for sure, I'm singling people out.
75487|0x005E2D17|While I can't say for sure, I'm~singling people out.
75488|0x005E2D75|Well, it doesn't seem to be at random, at least, but it's still~awfully disturbing.
75489|0x005E2DD3|Well, it doesn't seem to be at~random, at least, but it's~still awfully disturbing.
75490|0x005E2E4E|You're really cheeky for a stupid Mokomoko.
75491|0x005E2E84|You're really cheeky for a~stupid Mokomoko.
75492|0x005E2EE4|What's that supposed to mean?!
75493|0x005E2F0D|What's that supposed to mean?!
75494|0x005E2F45|So what happened to that girl after you reaped her nightmare?
75495|0x005E2F8D|So what happened to that girl~after you reaped her nightmare?
75496|0x005E2FF2|She stopped crying.
75497|0x005E3010|She stopped crying.
75498|0x005E304D|Which told you that you succeeded in reaping her nightmare.
75499|0x005E3093|Which told you that you~succeeded in reaping her~nightmare.
75500|0x005E30F6|You are being really cheeky for a stupid Mokomoko.
75501|0x005E3133|You are being really cheeky for~a stupid Mokomoko.
75502|0x005E319A|Do you want me to hit you?!

75504|0x005E3211|What nightmare was it that you reaped?
75505|0x005E3242|What nightmare was it that you~reaped?
75506|0x005E3290|That I don't know. It's not like we talked any.
75507|0x005E32CA|That I don't know. It's not~like we talked any.
75508|0x005E3313|All right. Last question then. Was the lookout already off-limits when~you reaped that girl's nightmare?
75509|0x005E3386|All right. Last question then.~Was the lookout already~off-limits when you reaped that~girl's nightmare?
75510|0x005E340C|Mare looked puzzled.
75511|0x005E342B|Mare looked puzzled.
75512|0x005E3490|...Kogasaka-kun.
75513|0x005E34AB|...Kogasaka-kun.
75514|0x005E34D5|It's just a hypothesis, Hisakaki.
75515|0x005E3501|It's just a hypothesis,~Hisakaki.
75516|0x005E3532|Though admittedly a hypothesis that was far from pleasant in my mind.
75517|0x005E3582|Though admittedly a hypothesis~that was far from pleasant in~my mind.
75518|0x005E35D7|Basically, I suspected that it might have been Hisakaki who had the~accident here at the lookout.
75519|0x005E3643|Basically, I suspected that it~might have been Hisakaki who~had the accident here at the~lookout.
75520|0x005E36ED|How was it, Mare? Was the fence already here then?
75521|0x005E372A|How was it, Mare? Was the fence~already here then?
75522|0x005E3784|...Beats me.
75523|0x005E379B|...Beats me.
75524|0x005E37B7|Mare shook her head.
75525|0x005E37D6|Mare shook her head.
75526|0x005E3812|I never paid attention to that.
75527|0x005E383C|I never paid attention to that.
75528|0x005E386B|I sank into thought.
75529|0x005E388A|I sank into thought.
75530|0x005E38AE|I would say the biggest issue at hand is the fact that Hisakaki~herself has no recollection of having been to the lookout as a kid.
75531|0x005E393C|I would say the biggest issue~at hand is the fact that~Hisakaki herself has no~recollection of having been to
75532|0x005E39B9|If it really was her involved in the accident, that'd probably leave~us with two options for the lack of memory.
75533|0x005E3A34|If it really was her involved~in the accident, that'd~probably leave us with two~options for the lack of memory.
75534|0x005E3AB4|The first: she lost her memories due to shock, like receiving a strong~impact to the skull.
75535|0x005E3B1A|The first: she lost her~memories due to shock, like~receiving a strong impact to~the skull.
75536|0x005E3B85|The second: the memories of the accident itself were what Mare reaped.
75537|0x005E3BD6|The second: the memories of the~accident itself were what Mare~reaped.
75538|0x005E3C36|Thanks, Mare.
75539|0x005E3C4E|Thanks, Mare.
75540|0x005E3C89|...Is that all?
75541|0x005E3CA3|...Is that all?
75542|0x005E3CCC|Yeah. We're leaving now.
75543|0x005E3CEF|Yeah. We're leaving now.
75544|0x005E3D17|We couldn't stay here for long, since of course, I was worried about~Hisakaki's condition.
75545|0x005E3D7C|We couldn't stay here for long,~since of course, I was worried~about Hisakaki's condition.
75546|0x005E3DE6|Besides, we'd gotten valuable information. It would help us decide~where to go from this point forward.
75547|0x005E3E58|Besides, we'd gotten valuable~information. It would help us~decide where to go from this~point forward.
75548|0x005E3EE7|So I don't have to reap this girl's nightmare?
75549|0x005E3F20|So I don't have to reap this~girl's nightmare?
75550|0x005E3F68|Nope. We're putting it off for now.
75551|0x005E3F96|Nope. We're putting it off for~now.
75552|0x005E4000|...It seems awfully unreliable, so I can guarantee that I, at least,~won't ever ask you to do it.

75556|0x005E418B|You are obviously the one acting cheeky here!

75558|0x005E4221|After yelling, she crouched down weakly.
75559|0x005E4254|After yelling, she crouched~down weakly.
75560|0x005E42D8|...It's because you yell like that.

75562|0x005E4353|And whose fault is that?!

75584|0x005E48C6|Could you stop being so misleading?!
75585|0x005E48F5|Could you stop being so~misleading?!
75586|0x005E4929|Well, the way I see it, it was just her being overly self-conscious,~but since I am pretty sure I'd get kicked again the moment I say that,~I chose to keep my mouth shut.

75596|0x005E4D80|To meet that goal, she needed for Hisakaki Komomo to enter the~lookout.
75597|0x005E4DD2|To meet that goal, she needed~for Hisakaki Komomo to enter~the lookout.

75606|0x005E514F|The two reasons for that are as follows. For one thing, Setsuna is~proficient at this sort of work, and secondly, unlike others of her~kind, it is possible to send -her- back effortlessly.

75678|0x005E739D|Exactly.

75684|0x005E74FC|Should be fine just ignoring her then.

75696|0x005E787E|Why wouldn't you believe me?

75712|0x005E7CE8|...Understood.
75713|0x005E7D01|...Understood.
75714|0x005E7D39|However, since another contumacious existence has been discovered,~even if it is not my duty to take care of her, it's very nearly~certain that another shrine maiden will be dispatched to subjugate~her.

75724|0x005E8177|Yeah. I've heard her and Kosame talking about it a few times.
75725|0x005E81BF|Yeah. I've heard her and Kosame~talking about it a few times.
75726|0x005E8226|The trigger appears to be Hisakaki Komomo having entered the lookout.

75728|0x005E82E5|It would have to be.
75729|0x005E8304|It would have to be.
75730|0x005E8342|So...
75731|0x005E8352|So...
75732|0x005E8381|Let me guess. You want permission to send -her- back, yeah?
75733|0x005E83C7|Let me guess. You want~permission to send -her- back,~yeah?
75734|0x005E842C|......

75738|0x005E84C2|...No, nothing.
75739|0x005E84DC|...No, nothing.
75740|0x005E8515|I think it's only a matter of time before Komomo remembers everything.~Now that the nightmare that haunted her in the past is back, we're~only counting down the days.
75741|0x005E85C6|I think it's only a matter of~time before Komomo remembers~everything. Now that the~nightmare that haunted her in
75742|0x005E8682|As such, I hereby order you to send -her- back.
75743|0x005E86BC|As such, I hereby order you to~send -her- back.
75744|0x005E8707|After all, I believe the time for my daughter to face that reality has~now come.
75745|0x005E8762|After all, I believe the time~for my daughter to face that~reality has now come.
75746|0x005E87FC|Setsuna gravely accepted that command.

75754|0x005E8A03|In the middle of that crimson world, there she is, simply falling.

75756|0x005E8AA2|As she falls, falls ever further, she finds a silhouette awaiting her~below.
75757|0x005E8AF9|As she falls, falls ever~further, she finds a silhouette~awaiting her below.
75758|0x005E8B55|It has a face.
75759|0x005E8B6E|It has a face.
75760|0x005E8B8C|A pair of eyes, too, and a nose, and a mouth.
75761|0x005E8BC4|A pair of eyes, too, and a~nose, and a mouth.
75762|0x005E8C01|She can't make out ears.
75763|0x005E8C24|She can't make out ears.
75764|0x005E8C4C|They must be covered by the person's hair.
75765|0x005E8C81|They must be covered by the~person's hair.
75766|0x005E8CBB|The silhouette does, in fact, have long hair.
75767|0x005E8CF3|The silhouette does, in fact,~have long hair.
75768|0x005E8D30|As such, she can conclude with near certainty that the person is a~girl.
75769|0x005E8D83|As such, she can conclude with~near certainty that the person~is a girl.
75770|0x005E8DDB|At that place, coated in both green and black, which she is unable to~distinguish as earth or sky, there is a girl. A girl colored a deep~red.
75771|0x005E8E74|At that place, coated in both~green and black, which she is~unable to distinguish as earth~or sky, there is a girl. A girl
75772|0x005E8EFE|The red that stains her is more vivid than the sunset's crimson.
75773|0x005E8F49|The red that stains her is more~vivid than the sunset's~crimson.
75774|0x005E8F99|So, she is led to believe that maybe the red she sees all around her~doesn't stem from only the sunset, but maybe also comes from the girl.
75775|0x005E902F|So, she is led to believe that~maybe the red she sees all~around her doesn't stem from~only the sunset, but maybe also
75776|0x005E90B5|The moment she learns that, she starts to feel cold.

75778|0x005E9138|As she looks down on that girl's body, Komomo grows terribly cold,~knowing that body lying there could very well be her own.

75784|0x005E92F2|Before long even that sensation fades.

75786|0x005E9359|Everything fades to nothingness.
75787|0x005E9384|Everything fades to~nothingness.
75788|0x005E93B4|And then she learns.
75789|0x005E93D3|And then she learns.
75790|0x005E93F7|This is the sensation of death.
75791|0x005E9421|This is the sensation of death.
75792|0x005E9450|Final, absolute end.

75794|0x005E94B5|That is how Hisakaki Komomo dies within her nightmare.
75795|0x005E94F6|That is how Hisakaki Komomo~dies within her nightmare.

75798|0x005E9600|She was cold.

75800|0x005E9635|She felt on the verge of freezing to death.
75801|0x005E966B|She felt on the verge of~freezing to death.
75802|0x005E96A6|She even began to believe that maybe she hadn't yet woken her~nightmare.
75803|0x005E96F9|She even began to believe that~maybe she hadn't yet woken her~nightmare.
75804|0x005E9751|But her clattering teeth told her that wasn't the case.

75806|0x005E97DA|This is reality.

75810|0x005E98CA|She's freezing.

75814|0x005E9984|What awaits her is absolute nothingness.
75815|0x005E99B7|What awaits her is absolute~nothingness.
75816|0x005E99EF|She learned that what awaits her, at the end of her fall, is death.
75817|0x005E9A3D|She learned that what awaits~her, at the end of her fall, is~death.
75818|0x005E9A90|This was the first time that she had perceived it as the final,~absolute end in its truest sense.

76332|0x005F33C3|I told them something urgent came up so I couldn't attend the~scheduled meeting. It felt kind of bad to make excuses.

76334|0x005F34C8|Like Asuho, they were all completely understanding.

76336|0x005F3549|They told me to take care of Hisakaki, but I tried not to read too~much into that.

76338|0x005F3655|There you are.

76340|0x005F36BF|Setsuna-senpai was standing there as I left through the school gate.

76342|0x005F376C|...Long time no see.
76343|0x005F378B|...Long time no see.
76344|0x005F37C9|It sure is. I'd say it's been at least two months since we last~conversed.
76345|0x005F381E|It sure is. I'd say it's been~at least two months since we~last conversed.
76346|0x005F3882|Were you waiting for me?
76347|0x005F38A5|Were you waiting for me?
76348|0x005F38D9|I was.
76349|0x005F38EA|I was.
76350|0x005F390A|...I'm getting a bad feeling.
76351|0x005F3932|...I'm getting a bad feeling.
76352|0x005F3979|That feeling is likely accurate.
76353|0x005F39A4|That feeling is likely~accurate.
76354|0x005F39DE|Senpai, you should come to club sometime.
76355|0x005F3A12|Senpai, you should come to club~sometime.
76356|0x005F3A65|Is that some form of harassment?
76357|0x005F3A90|Is that some form of~harassment?
76358|0x005F3ACA|Well, I'm supposedly going to get harassed now, too.
76359|0x005F3B09|Well, I'm supposedly going to~get harassed now, too.
76360|0x005F3B67|We'll block the other students' way if we keep idling around here.~Would you be all right talking on our walk?

76362|0x005F3C68|...Well, we share part of the way anyway.

76368|0x005F3E9E|See, Kosame consulted me during lunch break.
76369|0x005F3ED5|See, Kosame consulted me during~lunch break.
76370|0x005F3F1B|I figured as much.
76371|0x005F3F38|I figured as much.
76372|0x005F3F74|Which made me regret the fact that I once thought you to be a mere~pebble.
76373|0x005F3FC9|Which made me regret the fact~that I once thought you to be a~mere pebble.
76374|0x005F402F|It turns out that you've been a huge enough hindrance for me to trip~up and fall before realizing my objective.

76376|0x005F4132|...What are you talking about?
76377|0x005F415B|...What are you talking about?
76378|0x005F41A3|Nothing you need to worry about.
76379|0x005F41CE|Nothing you need to worry~about.
76380|0x005F41FE|Setsuna-senpai listlessly brushed her hair out of her eyes.
76381|0x005F4244|Setsuna-senpai listlessly~brushed her hair out of her~eyes.
76382|0x005F42A9|If it were some time prior, I would've exterminated a threat the very~second it came in my way.
76383|0x005F4313|If it were some time prior, I~would've exterminated a threat~the very second it came in my~way.
76384|0x005F439C|However, you're a close friend of Kosame's, so I'll keep it to a mere~warning.
76385|0x005F43F5|However, you're a close friend~of Kosame's, so I'll keep it to~a mere warning.
76386|0x005F446D|You ought to be thankful to her.
76387|0x005F4498|You ought to be thankful to~her.
76388|0x005F44D2|...That's an awfully haughty tone to take.
76389|0x005F4507|...That's an awfully haughty~tone to take.
76390|0x005F455B|Make no mistake, you are my enemy. However, Kosame sees you as~anything but. I simply want you to understand the ensuing frustration~I have to suffer.
76391|0x005F45FC|Make no mistake, you are my~enemy. However, Kosame sees you~as anything but. I simply want~you to understand the ensuing
76392|0x005F468E|For now, I've at least understood that you care about Kosame-san.
76393|0x005F46DA|For now, I've at least~understood that you care about~Kosame-san.
76394|0x005F4745|...To my own regret, that is.
76395|0x005F476D|...To my own regret, that is.
76396|0x005F479A|Setsuna-senpai smiled scornfully.
76397|0x005F47C6|Setsuna-senpai smiled~scornfully.
76398|0x005F4811|I hear that you're looking into the accident that happened at the~lookout.
76399|0x005F4866|I hear that you're looking into~the accident that happened at~the lookout.
76400|0x005F48CA|I am.
76401|0x005F48DA|I am.
76402|0x005F4909|What do you intend to do upon uncovering the truth?
76403|0x005F4947|What do you intend to do upon~uncovering the truth?
76404|0x005F4994|I'll help Hisakaki.
76405|0x005F49B2|I'll help Hisakaki.
76406|0x005F49EF|So you're doing this all with her well-being in mind?
76407|0x005F4A2F|So you're doing this all with~her well-being in mind?
76408|0x005F4A7E|Yeah, and I'd also like you to tell me if you know something about it.
76409|0x005F4ACF|Yeah, and I'd also like you to~tell me if you know something~about it.
76410|0x005F4B3F|You should know I can't do that.
76411|0x005F4B6A|You should know I can't do~that.
76412|0x005F4BA4|Why are both you and Kosame-san so adamant about hiding it?
76413|0x005F4BEA|Why are both you and Kosame-san~so adamant about hiding it?
76414|0x005F4C4F|It's simply because I've been asked to.
76415|0x005F4C81|It's simply because I've been~asked to.
76416|0x005F4CC2|...By Mayaka-san?
76417|0x005F4CDE|...By Mayaka-san?
76418|0x005F4D19|I hardly expected you to guess that correctly.
76419|0x005F4D52|I hardly expected you to guess~that correctly.
76420|0x005F4D90|The dots were starting to connect.
76421|0x005F4DBD|The dots were starting to~connect.
76422|0x005F4DEF|The accident, Hisakaki's nightmares, and Mayaka-san, who is the one~hiding it all.
76423|0x005F4E4C|The accident, Hisakaki's~nightmares, and Mayaka-san, who~is the one hiding it all.
76424|0x005F4EB8|Why is she hiding it?
76425|0x005F4ED8|Why is she hiding it?
76426|0x005F4F17|You won't hear that from my mouth, nor from Kosame's, I'd say.
76427|0x005F4F60|You won't hear that from my~mouth, nor from Kosame's, I'd~say.
76428|0x005F4FAE|So Mayaka-san told them they aren't allowed to talk about it.
76429|0x005F4FF6|So Mayaka-san told them they~aren't allowed to talk about~it.
76430|0x005F505D|With regards to the accident, I understand that you want to know the~truth. But I'd like you to idly wait until Hisakaki Komomo catches on~to the meaning behind it by herself.
76431|0x005F5117|With regards to the accident, I~understand that you want to~know the truth. But I'd like~you to idly wait until Hisakaki
76432|0x005F51A9|Is that what Mayaka-san asked you to do?
76433|0x005F51DC|Is that what Mayaka-san asked~you to do?
76434|0x005F522E|Yes. And I'd urge you to do the same.
76435|0x005F525E|Yes. And I'd urge you to do the~same.
76436|0x005F529D|Catching on to the meaning of the accident means catching on to the~meaning behind her nightmares, I'm guessing?
76437|0x005F5318|Catching on to the meaning of~the accident means catching on~to the meaning behind her~nightmares, I'm guessing?
76438|0x005F53B2|Don't pry any deeper into this.
76439|0x005F53DC|Don't pry any deeper into this.
76440|0x005F5415|Why is that?
76441|0x005F542C|Why is that?
76442|0x005F5462|Because there's no point in any of this unless she comes to realize it~by herself.
76443|0x005F54BF|Because there's no point in any~of this unless she comes to~realize it by herself.
76444|0x005F552B|So you're saying my help is only making things worse?
76445|0x005F556B|So you're saying my help is~only making things worse?
76446|0x005F55CA|Exactly.
76447|0x005F55DD|Exactly.
76448|0x005F55FF|Those nightmares make her suffer. Is it really so strange for me to~want to relieve her of that?
76449|0x005F566A|Those nightmares make her~suffer. Is it really so strange~for me to want to relieve her~of that?
76450|0x005F56F4|No, I wouldn't say it is, but you must realize Mayaka-san herself~shares these sentiments.
76451|0x005F5759|No, I wouldn't say it is, but~you must realize Mayaka-san~herself shares these~sentiments.
76452|0x005F57CF|Probably.
76453|0x005F57E3|Probably.
76454|0x005F5806|...Don't just say probably.
76455|0x005F582C|...Don't just say probably.
76456|0x005F5871|Well, the thing is, I also find myself holding a fair amount of ill~will towards her.
76457|0x005F58D1|Well, the thing is, I also find~myself holding a fair amount of~ill will towards her.
76458|0x005F5940|So basically Mayaka-san is the big, evil boss here, huh?
76459|0x005F5983|So basically Mayaka-san is the~big, evil boss here, huh?
76460|0x005F59E5|Not necessarily evil, for that matter. Mayaka-san is doing what she~thinks is best, but you might be in the very process of making all of~her work meaningless.
76461|0x005F5A8F|Not necessarily evil, for that~matter. Mayaka-san is doing~what she thinks is best, but~you might be in the very
76462|0x005F5B19|That doesn't sit right with me.
76463|0x005F5B43|That doesn't sit right with me.
76464|0x005F5B8C|Mayaka-san loves her two daughters very dearly. That alone is~undoubtedly true.
76465|0x005F5BE6|Mayaka-san loves her two~daughters very dearly. That~alone is undoubtedly true.
76466|0x005F5C4F|...I just can't bring myself to believe that.
76467|0x005F5C87|...I just can't bring myself to~believe that.
76468|0x005F5CC4|If Mayaka-san knew the cause of Hisakaki's nightmares, then why did~she hide everything instead of doing something about it?
76469|0x005F5D4B|If Mayaka-san knew the cause of~Hisakaki's nightmares, then why~did she hide everything instead~of doing something about it?
76470|0x005F5DF1|Are you going to see Mayaka-san now?
76471|0x005F5E20|Are you going to see Mayaka-san~now?
76472|0x005F5E5E|I'm going to visit Hisakaki, and incidentally use the opportunity to~talk with Mayaka-san some, so yeah.
76473|0x005F5ED1|I'm going to visit Hisakaki,~and incidentally use the~opportunity to talk with~Mayaka-san some, so yeah.
76474|0x005F5F63|Kosame asked me to cut you down using the naginata if you answered~that question by saying the visitation part was incidental.
76475|0x005F5FEC|Kosame asked me to cut you down~using the naginata if you~answered that question by~saying the visitation part was
76476|0x005F6078|...Seitengu's shrine maidens are rather dangerous.
76477|0x005F60B5|...Seitengu's shrine maidens~are rather dangerous.
76478|0x005F6111|That's hardly something that should come as new to you, seeing how~much you've been around the elder Hisakaki sister.
76479|0x005F6191|That's hardly something that~should come as new to you,~seeing how much you've been~around the elder Hisakaki
76480|0x005F6259|All right then. This is my house right here, so see you around.
76481|0x005F62A3|All right then. This is my~house right here, so see you~around.
76482|0x005F6323|It would be best if you heeded my warning, but if you choose not to,~at the very least keep it in mind.
76483|0x005F6395|It would be best if you heeded~my warning, but if you choose~not to, at the very least keep~it in mind.
76484|0x005F6416|Yeah, I will.
76485|0x005F642E|Yeah, I will.
76486|0x005F6465|Farewell, then.
76487|0x005F647F|Farewell, then.
76488|0x005F64BB|Ah, hold on a second.
76489|0x005F64DB|Ah, hold on a second.
76490|0x005F653F|What is it?
76491|0x005F6555|What is it?
76492|0x005F657A|I wanted to talk with you about something. Mare, that is.
76493|0x005F65BE|I wanted to talk with you about~something. Mare, that is.
76494|0x005F6621|I won't lay a hand on the shinigami anymore, if that is what you're~asking.
76495|0x005F6677|I won't lay a hand on the~shinigami anymore, if that is~what you're asking.
76496|0x005F66DC|Can I trust your word on that?
76497|0x005F6705|Can I trust your word on that?
76498|0x005F674D|Yes.
76499|0x005F675C|Yes.
76500|0x005F677A|You know what Mare is, don't you?
76501|0x005F67A6|You know what Mare is, don't~you?
76502|0x005F67F1|You wish to know?
76503|0x005F680D|You wish to know?
76504|0x005F6838|Finding out won't change what I think of her, but I'm curious~nonetheless.
76505|0x005F688D|Finding out won't change what I~think of her, but I'm curious~nonetheless.
76506|0x005F6901|You truly like to beat around the bush.
76507|0x005F6933|You truly like to beat around~the bush.
76508|0x005F6974|You're the last person I want to hear that from.
76509|0x005F69AF|You're the last person I want~to hear that from.
76510|0x005F6A1D|I'm sure Kosame has already told you, but that thing is nothing but a~hallucination.
76511|0x005F6A7C|I'm sure Kosame has already~told you, but that thing is~nothing but a hallucination.
76512|0x005F6AFA|Although it is a hallucination, it isn't a product of the human mind.~It's a hallucination of something else ─ an illusory dream.
76513|0x005F6B87|Although it is a hallucination,~it isn't a product of the human~mind. It's a hallucination of~something else ─ an illusory
76514|0x005F6C2C|Because something else is dreaming of it, we end up seeing it, too.
76515|0x005F6C7A|Because something else is~dreaming of it, we end up~seeing it, too.
76516|0x005F6CD9|Since that something is an existence that encompasses all of us~humans, we can see that thing in our reality, without any need to be~inside a dream.
76517|0x005F6D78|Since that something is an~existence that encompasses all~of us humans, we can see that~thing in our reality, without
76518|0x005F6E07|......
76519|0x005F6E18|......
76520|0x005F6E2E|I couldn't quite comprehend that.
76521|0x005F6E5A|I couldn't quite comprehend~that.
76522|0x005F6EA5|And -she- is of the same kind.
76523|0x005F6ECE|And -she- is of the same kind.
76524|0x005F6F06|...She?
76525|0x005F6F18|...She?
76526|0x005F6F49|Someone who you are well acquainted with.
76527|0x005F6F7D|Someone who you are well~acquainted with.
76528|0x005F6FD0|So even though she is dead, she appears before us as an illusory~dream.
76529|0x005F7022|So even though she is dead, she~appears before us as an~illusory dream.
76530|0x005F7093|We can treat her as if she is a living being.
76531|0x005F70CB|We can treat her as if she is a~living being.
76532|0x005F7112|...And who exactly is she?
76533|0x005F7137|...And who exactly is she?
76534|0x005F717B|The elder Hisakaki sister will surely tell you that once she realizes~it herself.

76540|0x005F73B3|The place I fall towards is one that has a lot of vegetation.
76541|0x005F73FB|The place I fall towards is one~that has a lot of vegetation.
76542|0x005F7454|I fall, and then die, there.
76543|0x005F747B|I fall, and then die, there.
76544|0x005F74E6|That means 'she' refers to...
76545|0x005F750E|That means 'she' refers to...
76546|0x005F753B|(...Ridiculous. That just can't be.)
76547|0x005F756A|(...Ridiculous. That just can't~be.)
76548|0x005F75BD|In a hurry to get to Hisakaki's place, I stopped by home to drop off~my school bag.

76833|0x005FBCEA|Or what, are my words not~trustworthy enough?
76834|0x005FBD27|She lightly shook her head.
76835|0x005FBD4D|She lightly shook her head.
76836|0x005FBD78|Her eyes then regained their focus.
76837|0x005FBDA6|Her eyes then regained their~focus.
76838|0x005FBDD9|And looked back into mine.
76839|0x005FBDFE|And looked back into mine.
76840|0x005FBE42|H-Huh...?
76841|0x005FBE56|H-Huh...?
76842|0x005FBE6F|She finally came back to her senses.
76843|0x005FBE9E|She finally came back to her~senses.
76844|0x005FBEEC|Th-This is crazy... I was just planning to bring it up in a sort of~joking manner...
76845|0x005FBF4B|Th-This is crazy... I was just~planning to bring it up in a~sort of joking manner...
76846|0x005FBFC9|I wanted to go about it all casually...
76847|0x005FBFFB|I wanted to go about it all~casually...
76848|0x005FC03E|Casually... so it wouldn't sound so serious...
76849|0x005FC077|Casually... so it wouldn't~sound so serious...
76850|0x005FC0CF|Wh-Why... did I just, all of a sudden...

76852|0x005FC154|A-Ahaha...
76853|0x005FC169|A-Ahaha...
76854|0x005FC18D|...It is serious. I don't want you to just act like it's no big deal.
76855|0x005FC1DD|...It is serious. I don't want~you to just act like it's no~big deal.
76856|0x005FC24C|S-Sorry...
76857|0x005FC261|S-Sorry...
76858|0x005FC285|What for?
76859|0x005FC299|What for?
76860|0x005FC2CC|W-Well... I'm being a bother...
76861|0x005FC2F6|W-Well... I'm being a bother...
76862|0x005FC32F|That's not true. What would be a bother to me is if you tried to laugh~and joke about this.
76863|0x005FC395|That's not true. What would be~a bother to me is if you tried~to laugh and joke about this.
76864|0x005FC40A|Seeing you purposefully avoid my help is the thing that'd be most~painful to me.
76865|0x005FC465|Seeing you purposefully avoid~my help is the thing that'd be~most painful to me.
76866|0x005FC4D1|......
76867|0x005FC4E2|......
76868|0x005FC512|Get out of here... with those cheesy lines...
76869|0x005FC54A|Get out of here... with those~cheesy lines...
76870|0x005FC591|...Well, sorry about that.
76871|0x005FC5B6|...Well, sorry about that.
76872|0x005FC5EC|You better... be...
76873|0x005FC60A|You better... be...
76874|0x005FC647|Thanks to that... you're about to make me go and cry again...
76875|0x005FC68F|Thanks to that... you're about~to make me go and cry again...
76876|0x005FC6E6|There isn't anything wrong with that.
76877|0x005FC716|There isn't anything wrong with~that.
76878|0x005FC765|I absolutely can't...
76879|0x005FC785|I absolutely can't...
76880|0x005FC7B6|I can't let myself cry in front of you...
76881|0x005FC7EA|I can't let myself cry in front~of you...
76882|0x005FC82F|I won't let you see me cry...
76883|0x005FC857|I won't let you see me cry...
76884|0x005FC890|I just can't stand it...
76885|0x005FC8B3|I just can't stand it...
76886|0x005FC8E7|It'd be... like...
76887|0x005FC904|It'd be... like...
76888|0x005FC940|Admitting these feelings... and I just can't stand that thought.
76889|0x005FC98B|Admitting these feelings... and~I just can't stand that~thought.
76890|0x005FC9DB|Hisakaki cried, even though she tried to stifle her sobs.
76891|0x005FCA1F|Hisakaki cried, even though she~tried to stifle her sobs.
76892|0x005FCA68|All the while turning her back to me so that I wouldn't see her cry.
76893|0x005FCAB7|All the while turning her back~to me so that I wouldn't see~her cry.
76894|0x005FCB27|Waiting until she cried herself to sleep, I then left the room.
76895|0x005FCB71|Waiting until she cried herself~to sleep, I then left the room.
76896|0x005FCC18|Finally back, huh?
76897|0x005FCC35|Finally back, huh?
76898|0x005FCC7C|Mayaka-san was waiting in the living room.
76899|0x005FCCB1|Mayaka-san was waiting in the~living room.
76900|0x005FCCEB|Apparently, it took Hisakaki quite a long time to settle down, as the~color outside was now a deep shade of orange.
76901|0x005FCD69|Apparently, it took Hisakaki~quite a long time to settle~down, as the color outside was~now a deep shade of orange.
76902|0x005FCDEC|The sunset that Hisakaki fears so much.
76903|0x005FCE1E|The sunset that Hisakaki fears~so much.
76904|0x005FCE6F|How is Komomo doing?
76905|0x005FCE8E|How is Komomo doing?
76906|0x005FCEBC|Hisakaki... Er, I mean your daughter is sleeping just fine right now.
76907|0x005FCF0C|Hisakaki... Er, I mean your~daughter is sleeping just fine~right now.
76908|0x005FCF81|No need to call her that around me just 'cause I'm her mom.
76909|0x005FCFC7|No need to call her that around~me just 'cause I'm her mom.
76910|0x005FD01C|...Okay then.
76911|0x005FD034|...Okay then.
76912|0x005FD06B|Guess it's a bit confusing since I'm also a Hisakaki, but eh,~whatever.
76913|0x005FD0BD|Guess it's a bit confusing~since I'm also a Hisakaki, but~eh, whatever.
76914|0x005FD114|Mayaka-san pointed at the cushion opposite of the table she was~sitting at, and I sat down there.
76915|0x005FD180|Mayaka-san pointed at the~cushion opposite of the table~she was sitting at, and I sat~down there.
76916|0x005FD20B|There's a few things you want to ask me, right?
76917|0x005FD245|There's a few things you want~to ask me, right?
76918|0x005FD28E|I guess you heard from Kosame-san then.
76919|0x005FD2C0|I guess you heard from~Kosame-san then.
76920|0x005FD311|Sure did. On that subject, she was seriously about to cut you down~with our naginata if you would've come and talked to me before seeing~Komomo.
76921|0x005FD3AC|Sure did. On that subject, she~was seriously about to cut you~down with our naginata if you~would've come and talked to me
76922|0x005FD436|...Kosame-san, am I that untrustworthy in your eyes?
76923|0x005FD475|...Kosame-san, am I that~untrustworthy in your eyes?
76924|0x005FD4D3|The sun's about to set, so let's make this quick.
76925|0x005FD50F|The sun's about to set, so~let's make this quick.
76926|0x005FD55A|All right. I'll get straight to the matter then.
76927|0x005FD595|All right. I'll get straight to~the matter then.
76928|0x005FD5D5|I took one deep breath.
76929|0x005FD5F7|I took one deep breath.
76930|0x005FD628|What exactly happened to Hisakaki in the past, with regards to the~accident at the lookout?
76931|0x005FD68E|What exactly happened to~Hisakaki in the past, with~regards to the accident at the~lookout?
76932|0x005FD713|No kidding, that really is straight to the point.
76933|0x005FD74F|No kidding, that really is~straight to the point.
76934|0x005FD79A|Can you please answer the question?
76935|0x005FD7C8|Can you please answer the~question?
76936|0x005FD815|Sure.
76937|0x005FD825|Sure.
76938|0x005FD83A|She said all too readily.
76939|0x005FD85E|She said all too readily.
76940|0x005FD891|...Are you just going to give me a pack of lies to ward me away?
76941|0x005FD8DC|...Are you just going to give~me a pack of lies to ward me~away?
76942|0x005FD946|Why would I?
76943|0x005FD95D|Why would I?
76944|0x005FD983|Well, the thing is, I am under the impression that you're rather keen~on hiding things with regards to that accident.
76945|0x005FDA03|Well, the thing is, I am under~the impression that you're~rather keen on hiding things~with regards to that accident.
76946|0x005FDAA2|Can't really deny that.
76947|0x005FDAC4|Can't really deny that.
76948|0x005FDAF5|You're also hiding it from Hisakaki, right?
76949|0x005FDB2B|You're also hiding it from~Hisakaki, right?
76950|0x005FDB80|I guess I am, really. I'd be glad to tell her if she'd just come and~ask though.
76951|0x005FDBDB|I guess I am, really. I'd be~glad to tell her if she'd just~come and ask though.
76952|0x005FDC45|...So, you're saying you're not purposefully keeping the truth from~her?
76953|0x005FDC98|...So, you're saying you're not~purposefully keeping the truth~from her?
76954|0x005FDD0A|Nope.
76955|0x005FDD1A|Nope.
76956|0x005FDD39|......
76957|0x005FDD4A|......
76958|0x005FDD7A|You don't seem too convinced.
76959|0x005FDDA2|You don't seem too convinced.
76960|0x005FDDD9|...It's hard to not be skeptical. I mean, considering how she's the~one feeling the most anxiety because of this.
76961|0x005FDE55|...It's hard to not be~skeptical. I mean, considering~how she's the one feeling the~most anxiety because of this.
76962|0x005FDEF0|Yeah, she hasn't got a single memory of the incident. Not knowing~something you feel you should is something a lot more frightening than~you'd imagine.
76963|0x005FDF92|Yeah, she hasn't got a single~memory of the incident. Not~knowing something you feel you~should is something a lot more
76964|0x005FE019|I've experienced something like that, too, so I know the feeling.
76965|0x005FE065|I've experienced something like~that, too, so I know the~feeling.
76966|0x005FE0B6|Back when I lost the lookout girl's name, I was in a state basically~bordering on derangement.
76967|0x005FE11F|Back when I lost the lookout~girl's name, I was in a state~basically bordering on~derangement.
76968|0x005FE197|Despite that, she's never gone and asked you anything?
76969|0x005FE1D8|Despite that, she's never gone~and asked you anything?
76970|0x005FE238|Nope. Not even once.
76971|0x005FE257|Nope. Not even once.
76972|0x005FE285|But why?! That just doesn't make any sense!
76973|0x005FE2BB|But why?! That just doesn't~make any sense!
76974|0x005FE310|Well, I'd guess it's because she can tell it's not something I'm fond~of talking about.
76975|0x005FE372|Well, I'd guess it's because~she can tell it's not something~I'm fond of talking about.
76976|0x005FE3E5|So she just goes on not asking me anything...
76977|0x005FE41D|So she just goes on not asking~me anything...
76978|0x005FE474|She thinks she'll only be putting me out if she does.
76979|0x005FE4B4|She thinks she'll only be~putting me out if she does.
76980|0x005FE4F9|I was rendered speechless.
76981|0x005FE51E|I was rendered speechless.
76982|0x005FE55E|(Hisakaki...)
76983|0x005FE576|(Hisakaki...)
76984|0x005FE593|(You're such a damned strong girl, I swear.)
76985|0x005FE5CA|(You're such a damned strong~girl, I swear.)
76986|0x005FE606|(I just can't help but respect your inner strength... from the bottom~of my heart...)
76987|0x005FE666|(I just can't help but respect~your inner strength... from the~bottom of my heart...)
76988|0x005FE71B|...Mayaka-san.
76989|0x005FE734|...Mayaka-san.
76990|0x005FE76C|Yeah?
76991|0x005FE77C|Yeah?
76992|0x005FE79B|See, I'm nowhere near as strong as she is.
76993|0x005FE7D0|See, I'm nowhere near as strong~as she is.
76994|0x005FE824|Which is why you're questioning me now like this. Is that what you~mean to say?
76995|0x005FE87E|Which is why you're questioning~me now like this. Is that what~you mean to say?
76996|0x005FE8E7|Right.
76997|0x005FE8F8|Right.
76998|0x005FE928|That in itself shows that you're also strong, boy. Not everyone can~stand up and fight for another.
76999|0x005FE996|That in itself shows that~you're also strong, boy. Not~everyone can stand up and fight~for another.
77000|0x005FEA13|Hisakaki isn't just some other person.
77001|0x005FEA44|Hisakaki isn't just some other~person.
77002|0x005FEA94|You're already dating?
77003|0x005FEAB5|You're already dating?
77004|0x005FEAE5|N-No! I just meant friends is all!
77005|0x005FEB12|N-No! I just meant friends is~all!
77006|0x005FEB5E|If she gets married, I hope you're the groom.
77007|0x005FEB96|If she gets married, I hope~you're the groom.
77008|0x005FEBDD|You're thinking a bit too far ahead there!
77009|0x005FEC12|You're thinking a bit too far~ahead there!
77010|0x005FEC4C|She shifted us a bit off course, so I took a second to regain my~composure before going on.
77011|0x005FECB2|She shifted us a bit off~course, so I took a second to~regain my composure before~going on.
77012|0x005FED27|Back on topic.
77013|0x005FED40|Back on topic.
77014|0x005FED78|Oh, you recover fast.
77015|0x005FED98|Oh, you recover fast.
77016|0x005FEDC7|So could you please tell me exactly what happened during that~accident?
77017|0x005FEE19|So could you please tell me~exactly what happened during~that accident?
77018|0x005FEE8A|What will you do if I refuse to tell you?
77019|0x005FEEBE|What will you do if I refuse to~tell you?
77020|0x005FEF01|I'll turn my sights to town hall then. They should at least be able to~give me the exact date the fence was erected.
77021|0x005FEF80|I'll turn my sights to town~hall then. They should at least~be able to give me the exact~date the fence was erected.
77022|0x005FF01E|And then you'd use that as your lead, and dig further.
77023|0x005FF05F|And then you'd use that as your~lead, and dig further.
77024|0x005FF0AF|Exactly.
77025|0x005FF0C2|Exactly.
77026|0x005FF0FA|Got it. Like I said in the beginning, I'll tell you. It sure wouldn't~feel too pleasant having you sniffing around like a detective.
77027|0x005FF189|Got it. Like I said in the~beginning, I'll tell you. It~sure wouldn't feel too pleasant~having you sniffing around like
77028|0x005FF210|I readied myself to carefully listen to what she was about to tell me.
77029|0x005FF261|I readied myself to carefully~listen to what she was about to~tell me.
77030|0x005FF2D7|That accident happened seven years ago, around early summer.
77031|0x005FF31E|That accident happened seven~years ago, around early summer.
77032|0x005FF36A|The year I moved away from Hibarigasaki.
77033|0x005FF39D|The year I moved away from~Hibarigasaki.
77034|0x005FF3EF|See, Komomo went and climbed up a tree at the lookout. It was evening,~so I'd guess her surroundings were bright red at the time.
77035|0x005FF47B|See, Komomo went and climbed up~a tree at the lookout. It was~evening, so I'd guess her~surroundings were bright red at
77036|0x005FF502|That matched with what Hisakaki always saw in her nightmares.
77037|0x005FF54A|That matched with what Hisakaki~always saw in her nightmares.
77038|0x005FF5A3|After that, she fell out of the tree. Must have slipped or something.
77039|0x005FF5F3|After that, she fell out of the~tree. Must have slipped or~something.
77040|0x005FF662|She was pretty high up, but the one fortunate thing is that she didn't~get injured.
77041|0x005FF6C0|She was pretty high up, but the~one fortunate thing is that she~didn't get injured.
77042|0x005FF72D|...She didn't get injured at all?
77043|0x005FF759|...She didn't get injured at~all?
77044|0x005FF7A4|Nope. When I hurried up to the lookout, she was walking around like~nothing even happened.
77045|0x005FF809|Nope. When I hurried up to the~lookout, she was walking around~like nothing even happened.
77046|0x005FF873|That part didn't agree with her nightmares.
77047|0x005FF8A9|That part didn't agree with her~nightmares.
77048|0x005FF8E4|Either Mayaka-san was lying, or else...
77049|0x005FF916|Either Mayaka-san was lying, or~else...
77050|0x005FF967|So, to prevent something like that from happening in the future, I~approached the town, told them I'd like them to make sure kids can't~easily get in there.
77051|0x005FFA0E|So, to prevent something like~that from happening in the~future, I approached the town,~told them I'd like them to make
77052|0x005FFAAF|So they put up a fence.
77053|0x005FFAD1|So they put up a fence.
77054|0x005FFB02|Is that really the truth?
77055|0x005FFB26|Is that really the truth?
77056|0x005FFB69|Why are you doubting me here?
77057|0x005FFB91|Why are you doubting me here?
77058|0x005FFBC8|Such a tiny little incident like that doesn't come anywhere near to~explaining her nightmares.
77059|0x005FFC31|Such a tiny little incident~like that doesn't come anywhere~near to explaining her~nightmares.
77060|0x005FFCB9|I also know about her nightmares. After all, she was tormented by~those right after her accident.
77061|0x005FFD25|I also know about her~nightmares. After all, she was~tormented by those right after~her accident.
77062|0x005FFDA2|The way I see it, she suffered a lasting trauma 'cause of it. She~wasn't hurt, and she didn't seem fazed by it at all, but deep down in~the depths of her consciousness, that accident instilled a fear in~her.
77063|0x005FFE7C|The way I see it, she suffered~a lasting trauma 'cause of it.~She wasn't hurt, and she didn't~seem fazed by it at all, but
77064|0x005FFF20|She began to unconsciously fear the lookout...
77065|0x005FFF59|She began to unconsciously fear~the lookout...
77066|0x005FFFB1|Well, after a bit of time had passed, she'd completely forgotten the~accident ever happened.
77067|0x00600018|Well, after a bit of time had~passed, she'd completely~forgotten the accident ever~happened.
77068|0x00600090|Which also meant her nightmares went away.
77069|0x006000C5|Which also meant her nightmares~went away.
77070|0x00600109|Do you know what exactly caused her to forgot it?
77071|0x00600145|Do you know what exactly caused~her to forgot it?
77072|0x006001A0|Not a clue. It doesn't seem like there's any use asking her herself~since she's forgotten the whole thing.

77074|0x0060029B|Fortunately enough, the particulars of the accident essentially went~unheard of throughout the town, so nobody ever told Komomo about it.

77080|0x006004E7|I don't think it'd even been a month since the accident.
77081|0x0060052A|I don't think it'd even been a~month since the accident.
77082|0x0060057C|You didn't hush up the particulars of the accident?
77083|0x006005BA|You didn't hush up the~particulars of the accident?
77084|0x00600617|What kind of villian are you making me out to be? I just didn't report~it to the police or anything.
77085|0x00600686|What kind of villian are you~making me out to be? I just~didn't report it to the police~or anything.
77086|0x00600706|Wasn't the level of accident worth making a fuss over in the first~place.
77087|0x0060075A|Wasn't the level of accident~worth making a fuss over in the~first place.
77088|0x006007BD|But you approached the town hall to put up a fence there, right?
77089|0x00600808|But you approached the town~hall to put up a fence there,~right?
77090|0x00600872|Well, to be precise, it wasn't me.
77091|0x0060089F|Well, to be precise, it wasn't~me.
77092|0x006008EB|And to be perfectly honest, I didn't even want to make the lookout~off-limits.
77093|0x00600944|And to be perfectly honest, I~didn't even want to make the~lookout off-limits.
77094|0x006009BC|I was a member of the Astronomy Club, after all.
77095|0x006009F7|I was a member of the Astronomy~Club, after all.
77096|0x00600A43|I love the starry sky here in Hibaragasaki.
77097|0x00600A79|I love the starry sky here in~Hibaragasaki.
77098|0x00600ACE|Plus, I'd hardly be able to show my face to our old teach if I did~that.

77102|0x00600C2C|Who was it then?

77104|0x00600C81|My husband.
77105|0x00600C97|My husband.
77106|0x00600CB2|A person I hadn't even thought of until this moment entered the~picture.
77107|0x00600D05|A person I hadn't even thought~of until this moment entered~the picture.
77108|0x00600D77|After the accident, we had a conversation about it.
77109|0x00600DB5|After the accident, we had a~conversation about it.
77110|0x00600E04|If things had gone even a little differently, Komomo could've had a~much more serious injury, so he was honestly fine with having the~whole lookout torn down.
77111|0x00600EAD|If things had gone even a~little differently, Komomo~could've had a much more~serious injury, so he was
77112|0x00600F3E|Since it was his own daughter involved, I suppose his anger was only~natural. If you see it like that, I guess I might be a pretty~heartless person.
77113|0x00600FDD|Since it was his own daughter~involved, I suppose his anger~was only natural. If you see it~like that, I guess I might be a
77114|0x00601082|Though he also respected my opinion, so he ultimately left it at just~putting up a fence there.
77115|0x006010EC|Though he also respected my~opinion, so he ultimately left~it at just putting up a fence~there.
77116|0x00601165|Your husband is a doctor, right?
77117|0x00601190|Your husband is a doctor,~right?
77118|0x006011CC|Yeah, so he was also who I had examine Komomo. He's actually skilled~at both surgery and being a regular physician.
77119|0x0060124A|Yeah, so he was also who I had~examine Komomo. He's actually~skilled at both surgery and~being a regular physician.
77120|0x006012D7|And Hisakaki didn't have any injuries?
77121|0x00601308|And Hisakaki didn't have any~injuries?
77122|0x0060134A|That's right.
77123|0x00601362|That's right.
77124|0x00601389|So there's nothing that can be done from a medical perspective to make~her nightmares go away?
77125|0x006013F2|So there's nothing that can be~done from a medical perspective~to make her nightmares go away?
77126|0x0060147A|Didn't I tell you? Komomo doesn't rely on me. Naturally, that means~she doesn't rely on her father either.
77127|0x006014EF|Didn't I tell you? Komomo~doesn't rely on me. Naturally,~that means she doesn't rely on~her father either.
77128|0x00601583|When it comes to psychological problems like nightmares, you need the~patient's cooperation before you can do anything. Just giving them~pills makes things worse, apparently.
77129|0x0060163C|When it comes to psychological~problems like nightmares, you~need the patient's cooperation~before you can do anything.
77130|0x006016CF|Well, that's just what my husband told me.
77131|0x00601704|Well, that's just what my~husband told me.
77132|0x00601748|So your husband is also just letting it go?
77133|0x0060177E|So your husband is also just~letting it go?
77134|0x006017D3|I'd rather you not phrase it like he's just turning a blind eye.
77135|0x0060181E|I'd rather you not phrase it~like he's just turning a blind~eye.
77136|0x00601878|I really appreciate his help with Chinami a while back.

77140|0x00601962|Your husband seems like a very gentle, caring person to me.
77141|0x006019A8|Your husband seems like a very~gentle, caring person to me.
77142|0x00601A0D|Well, you haven't seen him when he's mad. Back when he always had to~scold me for being a little daredevil, he always had this incredibly~menacing look on his face.
77143|0x00601ABC|Well, you haven't seen him when~he's mad. Back when he always~had to scold me for being a~little daredevil, he always had
77144|0x00601B45|I did hear that Mayaka-san used to be a delinquent back in the day.
77145|0x00601B93|I did hear that Mayaka-san used~to be a delinquent back in the~day.
77146|0x00601C00|There was a time when Hibari High had problems with delinquency.~Though it seems like they've gotten past that by now.
77147|0x00601C81|There was a time when Hibari~High had problems with~delinquency. Though it seems~like they've gotten past that
77148|0x00601D09|I do remember Hisakaki saying there was a time when things really~escalated because a lot of students were just looking to mess around.

77150|0x00601E3C|Yep. Though, well, I was also one of those troublemakers back then.
77151|0x00601E8A|Yep. Though, well, I was also~one of those troublemakers back~then.
77152|0x00601EE9|Back then, my husband was a student at med school who lived nearby.~Kinda like the somewhat older guy from next door.
77153|0x00601F69|Back then, my husband was a~student at med school who lived~nearby. Kinda like the somewhat~older guy from next door.
77154|0x00601FFA|Of course, being in med school it was only during summer break that he~was able to come home to Hibarigasaki.
77155|0x00602072|Of course, being in med school~it was only during summer break~that he was able to come home~to Hibarigasaki.
77156|0x006020FB|Whenever saw me all bruised up from pulling my latest reckless stunt,~he'd get really compassionate, only to soon after scold me and treat~my wounds whether I wanted him to or not.
77157|0x006021BA|Whenever saw me all bruised up~from pulling my latest reckless~stunt, he'd get really~compassionate, only to soon
77158|0x00602255|Though whenever he did that, I wouldn't hesitate to give him a nice,~firm kick in the butt.
77159|0x006022BB|Though whenever he did that, I~wouldn't hesitate to give him a~nice, firm kick in the butt.
77160|0x00602330|...Talk about heartless.
77161|0x00602353|...Talk about heartless.
77162|0x00602395|Can you blame me? Normally people like that are only perverts with a~knack for that sort of stuff. You know, it's like when kids want to~play doctor.
77163|0x00602435|Can you blame me? Normally~people like that are only~perverts with a knack for that~sort of stuff. You know, it's
77164|0x006024D0|If he ever pulled out a stethoscope, I would've kicked his ass so hard~he'd gone home crying.
77165|0x00602538|If he ever pulled out a~stethoscope, I would've kicked~his ass so hard he'd gone home~crying.
77166|0x006025A5|My mental image of him was slanting towards a not-so-good direction.
77167|0x006025F4|My mental image of him was~slanting towards a not-so-good~direction.
77168|0x00602662|But well, that was just a misunderstanding on my part. His concern was~genuine.
77169|0x006026BC|But well, that was just a~misunderstanding on my part.~His concern was genuine.
77170|0x00602727|I sure as hell didn't enjoy being scolded by him, so I'd always let~him treat me. And now, X years later, here I am married to the guy.
77171|0x006027B9|I sure as hell didn't enjoy~being scolded by him, so I'd~always let him treat me. And~now, X years later, here I am
77172|0x00602846|Okay, back on topic then.
77173|0x0060286A|Okay, back on topic then.
77174|0x006028AD|...You could at least be polite enough to feign interest when I'm~telling you how we met.
77175|0x00602911|...You could at least be polite~enough to feign interest when~I'm telling you how we met.
77176|0x00602984|So is that all there is to the accident?
77177|0x006029B7|So is that all there is to the~accident?
77178|0x00602A09|Basically, yeah.
77179|0x00602A24|Basically, yeah.
77180|0x00602A4E|I can trust your word?
77181|0x00602A6F|I can trust your word?
77182|0x00602AAF|Oh, you bet. Nobody more trustworthy than me out there.
77183|0x00602AF1|Oh, you bet. Nobody more~trustworthy than me out there.
77184|0x00602B42|...You're kind of achieving the exact opposite there.
77185|0x00602B82|...You're kind of achieving the~exact opposite there.
77186|0x00602BE1|But I promise you I'm not lying.
77187|0x00602C0C|But I promise you I'm not~lying.
77188|0x00602C46|So in other words, there is a different truth to it as well.
77189|0x00602C8D|So in other words, there is a~different truth to it as well.
77190|0x00602CF3|I never said that.
77191|0x00602D10|I never said that.
77192|0x00602D3C|Why do you think Hisakaki started to have these nightmares again after~all this time?
77193|0x00602D9C|Why do you think Hisakaki~started to have these~nightmares again after all this~time?
77194|0x00602E1B|She went to the lookout here recently, didn't she? I'd say that was~the trigger.
77195|0x00602E76|She went to the lookout here~recently, didn't she? I'd say~that was the trigger.
77196|0x00602EE2|My guess is that, while she doesn't remember the accident itself, her~memories have unconsciously surfaced.
77197|0x00602F58|My guess is that, while she~doesn't remember the accident~itself, her memories have~unconsciously surfaced.
77198|0x00602FDD|It seems like you want Hisakaki to catch on to the truth by herself.
77199|0x0060302C|It seems like you want Hisakaki~to catch on to the truth by~herself.
77200|0x0060308A|Which is apparently why you're also forbidding Kosame-san and~Setsuna-senpai from saying anything.
77201|0x006030F7|Which is apparently why you're~also forbidding Kosame-san and~Setsuna-senpai from saying~anything.
77202|0x00603173|But I will save her.
77203|0x00603192|But I will save her.
77204|0x006031D0|This shrine here will do as an engagement gift, right?
77205|0x00603211|This shrine here will do as an~engagement gift, right?
77206|0x00603261|Look, like I said, you're thinking a bit too far ahead there!
77207|0x006032A9|Look, like I said, you're~thinking a bit too far ahead~there!
77208|0x00603310|She's lucky to have a guy like you.
77209|0x0060333E|She's lucky to have a guy like~you.
77210|0x00603371|Mayaka-san took a breath.
77211|0x00603395|Mayaka-san took a breath.
77212|0x006033D8|But let me just say this.
77213|0x006033FC|But let me just say this.
77214|0x00603431|Wanting to save her is fine. But the one thing you have to avoid is~becoming her way out.
77215|0x00603495|Wanting to save her is fine.~But the one thing you have to~avoid is becoming her way out.
77216|0x00603508|I know how strong she is. She'll never think of using me as an easy~way out.
77217|0x0060355F|I know how strong she is.~She'll never think of using me~as an easy way out.
77218|0x006035C5|I mean, she's always sending me flying with her kicks.
77219|0x00603606|I mean, she's always sending me~flying with her kicks.
77220|0x00603666|...Oh, is that so?
77221|0x00603683|...Oh, is that so?
77222|0x006036A5|Mayaka-san nodded as if realizing something for the first time.
77223|0x006036EF|Mayaka-san nodded as if~realizing something for the~first time.
77224|0x00603758|Now doesn't that sound familiar.
77225|0x00603783|Now doesn't that sound~familiar.
77226|0x006037BF|Just like me and my husband.
77227|0x006037E6|Just like me and my husband.
77228|0x0060382C|Meaning, to Komomo, you aren't her way out, but her guidepost.
77229|0x00603875|Meaning, to Komomo, you aren't~her way out, but her guidepost.
77230|0x006038C3|At that, she flashed me an affectionate smile.
77231|0x006038FC|At that, she flashed me an~affectionate smile.
77232|0x0060396B|As her mother, let me just say thank you.
77233|0x0060399F|As her mother, let me just say~thank you.
77234|0x006039E4|I really appreciate everything you do for her.
77235|0x00603A1D|I really appreciate everything~you do for her.
77236|0x00603A75|And while I'm at it, let this heartless old mom here ask you a little~something.
77237|0x00603AD0|And while I'm at it, let this~heartless old mom here ask you~a little something.
77238|0x00603B4A|Please, if you could, stay by her side through thick and thin.
77239|0x00603B93|Please, if you could, stay by~her side through thick and~thin.
77240|0x00603C76|Uwah... Morning.

77244|0x00603D84|I kinda just fell asleep before I knew it...
77245|0x00603DBB|I kinda just fell asleep before~I knew it...
77246|0x00603E03|You have been sleep deprived, so I think that was just what you~needed.
77247|0x00603E55|You have been sleep deprived,~so I think that was just what~you needed.
77248|0x00603EC6|...True. After all, rare as it is, I didn't have a nightmare either.
77249|0x00603F15|...True. After all, rare as it~is, I didn't have a nightmare~either.
77250|0x00603F99|Upon which a thought flashed through Kosame's mind.
77251|0x00603FD7|Upon which a thought flashed~through Kosame's mind.
77252|0x0060401A|(I'm sure that's all thanks to Kogasaka-san.)
77253|0x00604052|(I'm sure that's all thanks to~Kogasaka-san.)
77254|0x006040D0|Though we all know it'll be back when I go to sleep tonight...
77255|0x00604119|Though we all know it'll be~back when I go to sleep~tonight...
77256|0x00604181|Eh, the way I see it, it's my own dream, so there's no point in~averting my eyes from it.
77257|0x006041E5|Eh, the way I see it, it's my~own dream, so there's no point~in averting my eyes from it.
77258|0x0060424E|(It's also thanks to Kogasaka-kun that Nee-san found the strength to~face reality.)
77259|0x006042AC|(It's also thanks to~Kogasaka-kun that Nee-san found~the strength to face reality.)
77260|0x0060435F|...I guess Kogasaka-kun's already long gone, huh?
77261|0x0060439B|...I guess Kogasaka-kun's~already long gone, huh?
77262|0x006043F6|Yes. Mom saw him off, it seems. Right now she's in the middle of~preparing dinner.
77263|0x00604453|Yes. Mom saw him off, it seems.~Right now she's in the middle~of preparing dinner.
77264|0x006044CF|I wonder if he saw me while I was asleep...

77268|0x00604629|Don't put such a vulgar spin on it, geez!
77269|0x0060465D|Don't put such a vulgar spin on~it, geez!

77282|0x0060498D|...Oh, right.
77283|0x006049A5|...Oh, right.
77284|0x006049DC|The idiot just shows up here uninvited all of a sudden. Thanks to~that, I opened my door for him still in my pajamas.

77288|0x00604B9D|Nee-san had plenty of complaints.
77289|0x00604BC9|Nee-san had plenty of~complaints.
77290|0x00604BFA|Her face also looked sullen, but even through that Kosame could tell.

77312|0x0060509B|I see you're quite the doofus tonight.
77313|0x006050CC|I see you're quite the doofus~tonight.
77314|0x0060510C|...Geez, what gives?
77315|0x0060512B|...Geez, what gives?
77316|0x00605167|You just look like you're lost, unlike last night.
77317|0x006051A4|You just look like you're lost,~unlike last night.
77318|0x006051F0|...I do?
77319|0x00605203|...I do?
77320|0x00605233|Yep.
77321|0x00605242|Yep.
77322|0x0060526E|Let me guess, you want to save Mokomoko?
77323|0x006052A1|Let me guess, you want to save~Mokomoko?
77324|0x006052D9|Her words had a certain criticizing tone to them.
77325|0x00605315|Her words had a certain~criticizing tone to them.
77326|0x00605360|...Right. But I'm a bit unsure what I should do.
77327|0x0060539B|...Right. But I'm a bit unsure~what I should do.
77328|0x006053F1|If what Mayaka-san told me really was all there was to the accident,~there was little to nothing I could do for Hisakaki anymore.
77329|0x0060547D|If what Mayaka-san told me~really was all there was to the~accident, there was little to~nothing I could do for Hisakaki
77330|0x00605505|It basically just came down to cheering her up by telling her that her~accident was nothing serious at all.
77331|0x0060557B|It basically just came down to~cheering her up by telling her~that her accident was nothing~serious at all.
77332|0x006055F6|But I couldn't get rid of her nightmare with my power alone.
77333|0x0060563D|But I couldn't get rid of her~nightmare with my power alone.
77334|0x00605689|I couldn't reap them with a scythe like Mare, nor could I treat her~medically like Mayaka-san's husband.
77335|0x006056FC|I couldn't reap them with a~scythe like Mare, nor could I~treat her medically like~Mayaka-san's husband.
77336|0x00605774|So how could I, as powerless as I am, be of help to Hisakaki from now~on?
77337|0x006057C8|So how could I, as powerless as~I am, be of help to Hisakaki~from now on?
77338|0x00605821|Despite going on and on about how I'd be the one to save her from her~nightmares, I hadn't even formed so much as a plan.
77339|0x006058A5|Despite going on and on about~how I'd be the one to save her~from her nightmares, I hadn't~even formed so much as a plan.
77340|0x0060597F|That girl whose nightmare I reaped as my first one. I think I already~told you that she was crying back then.
77341|0x006059F7|That girl whose nightmare I~reaped as my first one. I think~I already told you that she was~crying back then.
77342|0x00605A74|Mare suddenly began to talk.
77343|0x00605A9B|Mare suddenly began to talk.
77344|0x00605ADF|She is throwing stones at the night sky.
77345|0x00605B12|She is throwing stones at the~night sky.
77346|0x00605B54|...Stones?
77347|0x00605B69|...Stones?
77348|0x00605B9B|Like she has a grudge against the sky for some reason.
77349|0x00605BDC|Like she has a grudge against~the sky for some reason.
77350|0x00605C2C|I imagine she wasn't just crying out of sadness, but probably also out~of frustration.
77351|0x00605C8D|I imagine she wasn't just~crying out of sadness, but~probably also out of~frustration.
77352|0x00605D0B|Now I've told you all I know about that time.
77353|0x00605D43|Now I've told you all I know~about that time.

77355|0x00605DCD|You came here to ask me about~that, right?
77356|0x00605E11|...Pretty much.

77358|0x00605E62|If you want me to reap Mokomoko's nightmare, I'll gladly do that.
77359|0x00605EAE|If you want me to reap~Mokomoko's nightmare, I'll~gladly do that.

77361|0x00605F3D|I'll respect her own will in~this regard.
77362|0x00605F8E|What will you do if she refuses?
77363|0x00605FB9|What will you do if she~refuses?
77364|0x00605FF3|That's what's giving me problems.
77365|0x0060601F|That's what's giving me~problems.
77366|0x00606068|Do you really need to worry about that?
77367|0x0060609A|Do you really need to worry~about that?
77368|0x006060DB|...Of course I do.
77369|0x006060F8|...Of course I do.
77370|0x00606132|Judging by how she acted last night, I feel like you actually already~have your answer.
77371|0x00606194|Judging by how she acted last~night, I feel like you actually~already have your answer.
77372|0x006061FB|She said huffily.
77373|0x00606217|She said huffily.
77374|0x00606250|She seemed to be in pain when she entered the lookout, but when she~was talking with you, she got all spirited...
77375|0x006062CC|She seemed to be in pain when~she entered the lookout, but~when she was talking with you,~she got all spirited...
77376|0x0060634D|She spoke as if forcing herself to throw out words she didn't want to~say.
77377|0x006063A2|She spoke as if forcing herself~to throw out words she didn't~want to say.
77378|0x00606414|So honestly, I think you can save her.
77379|0x00606445|So honestly, I think you can~save her.
77380|0x00606493|Even without my help...
77381|0x006064B5|Even without my help...
77382|0x006064E5|Mare spun around, turning her back towards me.
77383|0x0060651E|Mare spun around, turning her~back towards me.
77384|0x0060658D|...Blockhead.
77385|0x006065A5|...Blockhead.
77386|0x006065FC|And then she disappeared.
77387|0x00606620|And then she disappeared.
77388|0x00606649|...How do I take that? Did she cheer me up?
77389|0x0060667F|...How do I take that? Did she~cheer me up?
77390|0x006066E3|Thanks, Mare.

77392|0x00606718|I guess all I wanted to do was vent.

77395|0x006067C7|I wanted to save Hisakaki from~her suffering as fast as~possible.
77396|0x00606818|Rushing things wouldn't do me any good at all.
77397|0x00606851|Rushing things wouldn't do me~any good at all.
77398|0x0060688F|There were still plenty of question marks surrounding that accident.
77399|0x006068DE|There were still plenty of~question marks surrounding that~accident.

77833|0x0060D71F|Can you trust me, at least for~just this one moment?
77834|0x0060D763|Hisakaki was dumbstruck for a moment.
77835|0x0060D793|Hisakaki was dumbstruck for a~moment.
77836|0x0060D7E2|...Doofus.
77837|0x0060D7F7|...Doofus.
77838|0x0060D811|She smiled lightly.

77844|0x0060D914|Maybe I owed her one more favor after that.
77845|0x0060D94A|Maybe I owed her one more favor~after that.
77846|0x0060D9CB|Mare, if you could.

77848|0x0060DA24|...I thought you were gonna respect her wishes?

77850|0x0060DADD|Mare-san. I'd also like to throw in my request.
77851|0x0060DB17|Mare-san. I'd also like to~throw in my request.
77852|0x0060DB56|Hearing Hisakaki's words, Mare renewed her grip on the scythe's shaft.
77853|0x0060DBA7|Hearing Hisakaki's words, Mare~renewed her grip on the~scythe's shaft.
77854|0x0060DC3E|Blockheads everywhere.

77856|0x0060DCBB|Mare raised her hand.
77857|0x0060DCDB|Mare raised her hand.
77858|0x0060DD00|The scythe in her hand sparkled with a silver seen.
77859|0x0060DD3E|The scythe in her hand sparkled~with a silver seen.
77860|0x0060DDB4|Hisakaki's body stiffened up.

77862|0x0060DE21|I'll do it quickly in one go, before you can change your mind.
77863|0x0060DE6A|I'll do it quickly in one go,~before you can change your~mind.
77864|0x0060DEEB|Regardless of how scared and uneasy she felt, she kept her eyes wide~open.
77865|0x0060DF40|Regardless of how scared and~uneasy she felt, she kept her~eyes wide open.
77866|0x0060DF9A|Her gaze fixed on Mare's scythe.
77867|0x0060DFC5|Her gaze fixed on Mare's~scythe.
77868|0x0060DFF5|Hisakaki's absolute trust towards me became readily apparent. I keenly~felt the depth of her trust in me.
77869|0x0060E069|Hisakaki's absolute trust~towards me became readily~apparent. I keenly felt the~depth of her trust in me.

77871|0x0060E16E|A straightforward, genuine kind~of trust that eclipsed the~trust she had in me when she~recommended me as Student

77873|0x0060E23C|I wanted to respond to that~trust and live up to her~expectations.
77874|0x0060E2CD|The scythe's sharp tip swept down towards Hisakaki's chest and─

77876|0x0060E376|─Wait!
77877|0x0060E388|─Wait!
77878|0x0060E3CB|A voice sounded out from our flanks.
77879|0x0060E3FA|A voice sounded out from our~flanks.
77880|0x0060E42E|I broke out in a cold sweat, realizing that my plan had worked.
77881|0x0060E478|I broke out in a cold sweat,~realizing that my plan had~worked.
77882|0x0060E501|Mare, that's enough. Stop for now.
77883|0x0060E52E|Mare, that's enough. Stop for~now.
77884|0x0060E578|...I don't have to reap her?

77886|0x0060E5D5|No, sorry.
77887|0x0060E5EA|No, sorry.
77888|0x0060E642|Hisakaki let out a huge sigh of relief.
77889|0x0060E674|Hisakaki let out a huge sigh of~relief.
77890|0x0060E6DC|A silhouette came walking our way.
77891|0x0060E709|A silhouette came walking our~way.
77892|0x0060E798|If you're looking to send back a contumacious existence, then please~go no further.
77893|0x0060E7F6|If you're looking to send back~a contumacious existence, then~please go no further.
77894|0x0060E859|It was Setsuna-senpai.
77895|0x0060E87A|It was Setsuna-senpai.
77896|0x0060E8BA|A contumacious existence does not necessarily have to be a deity...
77897|0x0060E908|A contumacious existence does~not necessarily have to be a~deity...
77898|0x0060E975|They can also take form as something a person wants desperately to~control but can't.
77899|0x0060E9D5|They can also take form as~something a person wants~desperately to control but~can't.
77900|0x0060EA54|That which we would call a nightmare.

77902|0x0060EAD3|If you reap her nightmare now, you may be making an irreversible~mistake.
77903|0x0060EB27|If you reap her nightmare now,~you may be making an~irreversible mistake.
77904|0x0060EB80|She wasn't wearing her shrine maiden clothes. Instead, she was in an~everyday casual outfit.
77905|0x0060EBE7|She wasn't wearing her shrine~maiden clothes. Instead, she~was in an everyday casual~outfit.
77906|0x0060EC53|I suppose she must have hurried here, as her breathing was ragged.
77907|0x0060ECA0|I suppose she must have hurried~here, as her breathing was~ragged.
77908|0x0060ECFC|I thought you might come.

77910|0x0060ED68|Either her, or Kosame-san.
77911|0x0060ED8D|Either her, or Kosame-san.
77912|0x0060EDB7|Before heading to the lookout together with Hisakaki, I sent~Kosame-san a message.
77913|0x0060EE14|Before heading to the lookout~together with Hisakaki, I sent~Kosame-san a message.
77914|0x0060EE76|In that message, I stated that I was going to ask Mare to reap~Hisakaki's nightmare tonight.
77915|0x0060EEDD|In that message, I stated that~I was going to ask Mare to reap~Hisakaki's nightmare tonight.
77916|0x0060EF49|After that, Kosame-san contacted Setsuna-senpai.
77917|0x0060EF84|After that, Kosame-san~contacted Setsuna-senpai.
77918|0x0060EFC4|And that's why Setsuna-senpai showed up here at the lookout.
77919|0x0060F00B|And that's why Setsuna-senpai~showed up here at the lookout.
77920|0x0060F0A5|Not Kosame-san, but Setsuna-senpai.
77921|0x0060F0D3|Not Kosame-san, but~Setsuna-senpai.
77922|0x0060F120|What are you thinking, doing such a thing?
77923|0x0060F155|What are you thinking, doing~such a thing?
77924|0x0060F199|I'm doing this for Hisakaki's own good.
77925|0x0060F1CB|I'm doing this for Hisakaki's~own good.
77926|0x0060F21C|Would you have gone through and her nightmare reaped had I not stepped~in?
77927|0x0060F271|Would you have gone through and~her nightmare reaped had I not~stepped in?
77928|0x0060F2D5|Well, I admit I took a bit of a gamble, trying to account for whether~you'd intervene or let it go.
77929|0x0060F343|Well, I admit I took a bit of a~gamble, trying to account for~whether you'd intervene or let~it go.
77930|0x0060F3D0|It's blatantly clear that you accounted for my showing up.
77931|0x0060F415|It's blatantly clear that you~accounted for my showing up.
77932|0x0060F469|As long as you didn't lie to me, yeah.

77934|0x0060F4EA|I didn't.
77935|0x0060F4FE|I didn't.
77936|0x0060F517|Setsuna-senpai smiled faintly.
77937|0x0060F540|Setsuna-senpai smiled faintly.
77938|0x0060F588|Kosame is my friend.
77939|0x0060F5A7|Kosame is my friend.
77940|0x0060F5E5|There's no way I could let this happen, knowing the amount of distress~it would bring Kosame.
77941|0x0060F64D|There's no way I could let this~happen, knowing the amount of~distress it would bring Kosame.
77942|0x0060F6C4|That's because Mare's scythe is a relic, isn't it?
77943|0x0060F701|That's because Mare's scythe is~a relic, isn't it?
77944|0x0060F75D|Right. Though, strictly speaking, I suppose it doesn't quite fit.
77945|0x0060F7A9|Right. Though, strictly~speaking, I suppose it doesn't~quite fit.
77946|0x0060F804|And because a nightmare reaped by a relic gets sent back, right?
77947|0x0060F84F|And because a nightmare reaped~by a relic gets sent back,~right?
77948|0x0060F8AB|Correct.
77949|0x0060F8BE|Correct.
77950|0x0060F8E0|It gets sent back to some other place, far from here...
77951|0x0060F922|It gets sent back to some other~place, far from here...
77952|0x0060F973|Disappearing from before our very eyes.
77953|0x0060F9A5|Disappearing from before our~very eyes.
77954|0x0060F9F6|Indeed. Which is why I could never let this come to pass.
77955|0x0060FA3A|Indeed. Which is why I could~never let this come to pass.

77962|0x0060FC32|...I've really lost my edge.

77964|0x0060FC9F|This means I've failed my job.

77967|0x0060FD4D|My job of sending -her- back~has ended in failure.
77968|0x0060FD8F|Setsuna-senpai smiled with amusement.
77969|0x0060FDBF|Setsuna-senpai smiled with~amusement.
77970|0x0060FDF4|It wasn't a smile of self-derision. This was the first time I'd seen~her smile like this.
77971|0x0060FE58|It wasn't a smile of~self-derision. This was the~first time I'd seen her smile~like this.

77979|0x006100ED|At this point, I can't say I~disagree with your assertion.
77980|0x00610151|Meaning that Mayaka-san is now my enemy, rather than you.

81108|0x00645E49|Let's hurry then.
81109|0x00645E65|Let's hurry then.
81110|0x00645ED2|Right.
81111|0x00645EE3|Right.
81112|0x00645F03|I mean, knowing Mare, she might go and do it without second thought.
81113|0x00645F52|I mean, knowing Mare, she might~go and do it without second~thought.
81114|0x0064601B|...Looks like they're off.

81116|0x006460A1|It would seem so.
81117|0x006460BD|It would seem so.
81118|0x006460F8|Tonight might finally be the night when the curtain falls.
81119|0x0064613D|Tonight might finally be the~night when the curtain falls.
81120|0x006461A1|You have only yourself to blame for the fact that it took this long.
81121|0x006461F0|You have only yourself to blame~for the fact that it took this~long.
81122|0x0064625E|You sure don't pull any punches.
81123|0x00646289|You sure don't pull any~punches.
81124|0x006462D3|I always wondered why you were keeping what we're doing from Hisakaki~Komomo.
81125|0x0064632B|I always wondered why you were~keeping what we're doing from~Hisakaki Komomo.
81126|0x00646394|Why you didn't tell her about her spiritual powers.
81127|0x006463D2|Why you didn't tell her about~her spiritual powers.
81128|0x0064642F|Why you thought it better for her to not remember.
81129|0x0064646C|Why you thought it better for~her to not remember.
81130|0x006464C8|Is that why it took this long?
81131|0x006464F1|Is that why it took this long?
81132|0x00646539|Indeed.
81133|0x0064654B|Indeed.
81134|0x0064657C|Komomo possesses a power that allows her to succeed in an Astral~Spirit Ritual in an unbelievable way. I can't just tell her over~dinner that she has such a scary power.
81135|0x00646630|Komomo possesses a power that~allows her to succeed in an~Astral Spirit Ritual in an~unbelievable way. I can't just
81136|0x006466CD|Was that your sole reason?
81137|0x006466F2|Was that your sole reason?
81138|0x00646736|Let me ask you in return. Do you have a guess as to why she forgot?
81139|0x00646784|Let me ask you in return. Do~you have a guess as to why she~forgot?
81140|0x006467F1|The mental trauma she suffered due to Kosame's death, or if not that,~it would have to be...
81141|0x00646858|The mental trauma she suffered~due to Kosame's death, or if~not that, it would have to~be...
81142|0x006468DE|Someone sent back her memories.
81143|0x00646908|Someone sent back her memories.
81144|0x00646951|Sent them back to the stars, our true birth place.
81145|0x0064698E|Sent them back to the stars,~our true birth place.
81146|0x006469EA|But that would mean that, at the time, it wasn't the accident, but~rather Seitengu's calling that was a nightmare to her.
81147|0x00646A6E|But that would mean that, at~the time, it wasn't the~accident, but rather Seitengu's~calling that was a nightmare to
81148|0x00646B0C|Right. Her memories of having summoned Kosame, having performed the~Astral Spirit Ritual.
81149|0x00646B70|Right. Her memories of having~summoned Kosame, having~performed the Astral Spirit~Ritual.
81150|0x00646BE5|And my guess is that's why she still can't remember how the Astral~Spirit Ritual is performed.
81151|0x00646C4E|And my guess is that's why she~still can't remember how the~Astral Spirit Ritual is~performed.
81152|0x00646CD6|If you think of it like that, one can reckon that she forgot her~memories of the accident itself due to shock.
81153|0x00646D4F|If you think of it like that,~one can reckon that she forgot~her memories of the accident~itself due to shock.
81154|0x00646DE7|Komomo's mind wasn't prepared to accept the death of her dear sister.~At least that's what my husband had to say about it.
81155|0x00646E6C|Komomo's mind wasn't prepared~to accept the death of her dear~sister. At least that's what my~husband had to say about it.
81156|0x00646F02|So I wanted to give her time.
81157|0x00646F2A|So I wanted to give her time.
81158|0x00646F71|I wanted to wait until she became ready to accept it.
81159|0x00646FB1|I wanted to wait until she~became ready to accept it.
81160|0x00647010|Of course, I didn't want to shock her with all this talk about her~spiritual powers, and Seitengu's calling.
81161|0x00647087|Of course, I didn't want to~shock her with all this talk~about her spiritual powers, and~Seitengu's calling.
81162|0x0064711D|That is why you also forebode Kosame from talking about it?
81163|0x00647163|That is why you also forebode~Kosame from talking about it?
81164|0x006471BA|Exactly.
81165|0x006471CD|Exactly.
81166|0x006471FF|So tonight we'll learn the results of Hisakaki Komomo accepting~Kosame's death, huh?
81167|0x0064725E|So tonight we'll learn the~results of Hisakaki Komomo~accepting Kosame's death, huh?
81168|0x006472DC|That's my guess.
81169|0x006472F7|That's my guess.
81170|0x00647331|Are you sure you don't want to stop her?
81171|0x00647364|Are you sure you don't want to~stop her?
81172|0x006473B6|Which of them? Komomo or Kosame?
81173|0x006473E1|Which of them? Komomo or~Kosame?
81174|0x0064742B|If you want to send Kosame back, then the former.
81175|0x00647467|If you want to send Kosame~back, then the former.
81176|0x006474C2|It's not like I have a clear-cut answer to this either.

81187|0x00647824|And so do I.
81188|0x0064785A|You're quite the cowardly adult, I must say.

81501|0x0064CD5B|Oh, I know that! That's the~Panspermia hypothesis, right?
81502|0x0064CDDC|So that means we owe our life to those meteorites?
81503|0x0064CE19|So that means we owe our life~to those meteorites?
81504|0x0064CE75|Well, according to that one theory, yeah. Though modern science still~lacks sufficient evidence to settle on one theory regarding the origin~of life.

82084|0x00657C13|What option would that be?
82085|0x00657C38|What option would that be?
82086|0x00657C6C|Helping you.

82094|0x00657E9C|To make sure that I won't attack Mare-san again...

82096|0x00657F25|...It's got nothing to do with that.

82102|0x006580B0|You really don't have to worry about it anymore.
82103|0x006580EB|You really don't have to worry~about it anymore.
82104|0x00658145|...I'm not doing anything of the sort.
82105|0x00658176|...I'm not doing anything of~the sort.
82106|0x006581B6|Well, then let me help you.
82107|0x006581DC|Well, then let me help you.
82108|0x00658221|Where is the connection between those two things?
82109|0x0065825D|Where is the connection between~those two things?
82110|0x006582A8|I just have a thing for sweeping the shrine grounds, okay. It's so~awesome I can't help myself. If you consider me a friend, let me help~you with it.

82114|0x00658431|Kosame-san gave me a look of disbelief.
82115|0x00658463|Kosame-san gave me a look of~disbelief.
82116|0x006584A4|If you've put the incident behind you like you said, and consider me a~friend like before, then I absolutely don't see why you wouldn't let~me.
82117|0x0065853E|If you've put the incident~behind you like you said, and~consider me a friend like~before, then I absolutely don't
82118|0x006585E0|...You're playing dirty.
82119|0x00658603|...You're playing dirty.
82120|0x00658635|I won't deny it.
82121|0x00658650|I won't deny it.
82122|0x00658690|What a perverted mind.
82123|0x006586B1|What a perverted mind.
82124|0x006586E1|We obviously weren't talking about that kind of dirty!
82125|0x00658722|We obviously weren't talking~about that kind of dirty!
82126|0x00658782|What sort of outfit do you want me wearing when sweeping in front of~you...?
82127|0x006587D9|What sort of outfit do you want~me wearing when sweeping in~front of you...?
82128|0x0065883F|The usual shrine maiden outfit would be just fine!
82129|0x0065887C|The usual shrine maiden outfit~would be just fine!
82130|0x006588D8|I see, so I mustn't wear any underwear...
82131|0x0065890C|I see, so I mustn't wear any~underwear...
82132|0x0065894F|That's when you wear a yukata, not a shrine maiden outfit!
82133|0x00658994|That's when you wear a yukata,~not a shrine maiden outfit!
82134|0x006589F8|Actually, it's the same in this regard, since both are Japanese~clothing.
82135|0x00658A4C|Actually, it's the same in this~regard, since both are Japanese~clothing.
82136|0x00658AAF|...So, uh, you haven't been wearing underwear this entire time?
82137|0x00658AF9|...So, uh, you haven't been~wearing underwear this entire~time?
82138|0x00658B62|What would you do if I said yes?
82139|0x00658B8D|What would you do if I said~yes?
82140|0x00658BBD|...Good question.
82141|0x00658BD9|...Good question.
82142|0x00658C14|I can't possibly imagine what sort of foul things you're doing to me~right now inside your mind...

82144|0x00658CFD|Here's your answer! Nothing at all!

82146|0x00658D78|...Sexual thoughts are taboo, okay?
82147|0x00658DA6|...Sexual thoughts are taboo,~okay?
82148|0x00658DE3|Could you stop putting me down when supposedly making a helpful~comment?!
82149|0x00658E37|Could you stop putting me down~when supposedly making a~helpful comment?!
82150|0x00658EAA|...You don't find my bare body appetizing?

82152|0x00658F23|Could you stop amusing yourself at my expense?!
82153|0x00658F5D|Could you stop amusing yourself~at my expense?!
82154|0x00658FB6|There is actually a special kind of underskirt you put on as underwear~when wearing shrine maiden clothes. However, Nee-san and I keep our~normal underwear on out of laziness.
82155|0x00659070|There is actually a special~kind of underskirt you put on~as underwear when wearing~shrine maiden clothes. However,
82156|0x006590F3|...That's what I would have guessed.
82157|0x00659122|...That's what I would have~guessed.
82158|0x00659170|I heard your mind clicking its tongue in disappointment.
82159|0x006591B3|I heard your mind clicking its~tongue in disappointment.
82160|0x00659205|Well, you heard wrong!
82161|0x00659226|Well, you heard wrong!
82162|0x00659266|Kogasaka-san, helping me is okay, but keep it to just the coming week.
82163|0x006592B7|Kogasaka-san, helping me is~okay, but keep it to just the~coming week.
82164|0x00659317|...Because we have Hibari Festival preparations after that?
82165|0x0065935D|...Because we have Hibari~Festival preparations after~that?
82166|0x006593C2|Yes. We'll quite have our hands full with the club.
82167|0x00659400|Yes. We'll quite have our hands~full with the club.
82168|0x0065944D|Sure thing. I wouldn't want to impose.
82169|0x0065947E|Sure thing. I wouldn't want to~impose.
82170|0x006594CE|I rather love that side of you.
82171|0x006594F8|I rather love that side of you.
82172|0x00659531|Just if there's ever too many leaves for you to do alone, tell me and~I'll come help.
82173|0x00659591|Just if there's ever too many~leaves for you to do alone,~tell me and I'll come help.
82174|0x00659610|It might also be a good idea to have you go buy sweet potatoes.
82175|0x0065965A|It might also be a good idea to~have you go buy sweet potatoes.
82176|0x006596A9|And then we could roast those all together.
82177|0x006596DF|And then we could roast those~all together.
82178|0x00659724|Anyhow, in response to your question, I'll choose you.
82179|0x00659765|Anyhow, in response to your~question, I'll choose you.
82180|0x006597D1|Kogasaka-san.
82181|0x006597E9|Kogasaka-san.
82182|0x00659814|Kosame-san looked me in the eye.
82183|0x0065983F|Kosame-san looked me in the~eye.
82184|0x0065986F|Her expression had become stern.
82185|0x0065989A|Her expression had become~stern.
82186|0x006598D6|I'll just leave you with this warning. I never had the right to make~any friends.
82187|0x00659932|I'll just leave you with this~warning. I never had the right~to make any friends.
82188|0x006599AD|That's what I've always told myself.
82189|0x006599DC|That's what I've always told~myself.
82190|0x00659A1C|And yet, because Nee-san cared for me like nothing had changed, I was~able to attend school and also join the Astro Club.
82191|0x00659AA0|And yet, because Nee-san cared~for me like nothing had~changed, I was able to attend~school and also join the Astro
82192|0x00659B2F|I became able to believe it was all right for me to make friends.
82193|0x00659B7B|I became able to believe it was~all right for me to make~friends.
82194|0x00659BE6|But even so...
82195|0x00659BFF|But even so...
82196|0x00659C2B|Her expression suddenly softened.
82197|0x00659C57|Her expression suddenly~softened.
82198|0x00659CA2|Even so, that's all I can be permitted.
82199|0x00659CD4|Even so, that's all I can be~permitted.
82200|0x00659D17|I don't have any right to experience a relationship that goes beyond~that...
82201|0x00659D6E|I don't have any right to~experience a relationship that~goes beyond that...
82202|0x00659DE4|I have no right to experience love.
82203|0x00659E12|I have no right to experience~love.
82204|0x00659E45|Kosame-san repeated the same words she once told me before.
82205|0x00659E8B|Kosame-san repeated the same~words she once told me before.
82206|0x00659ED6|I suppose the reason she brought that up again now was because she~meant to ward me away.
82207|0x00659F3A|I suppose the reason she~brought that up again now was~because she meant to ward me~away.
82208|0x00659FA3|A warning for me to keep my distance.
82209|0x00659FD3|A warning for me to keep my~distance.
82210|0x0065A012|May I, um... ask why that is?
82211|0x0065A03A|May I, um... ask why that is?
82212|0x0065A067|Kosame-san waved her index finger at me as she said...
82213|0x0065A0A8|Kosame-san waved her index~finger at me as she said...
82214|0x0065A108|You know, it's not polite to pry.
82215|0x0065A134|You know, it's not polite to~pry.
82216|0x0065A20A|Howdy there, I'd been waiting for ya.
82217|0x0065A23A|Howdy there, I'd been waiting~for ya.
82218|0x0065A2A6|...Don't give me such a casual greeting. We need to take this~seriously.
82219|0x0065A2F9|...Don't give me such a casual~greeting. We need to take this~seriously.
82220|0x0065A36B|You're so serious, like you don't know how to loosen up.
82221|0x0065A3AE|You're so serious, like you~don't know how to loosen up.
82222|0x0065A410|I act and conduct myself the same at any given time.
82223|0x0065A44F|I act and conduct myself the~same at any given time.
82224|0x0065A4AD|Well, I guess you're just too tense. Before long that frown will stick~on your face permanently.
82225|0x0065A518|Well, I guess you're just too~tense. Before long that frown~will stick on your face~permanently.
82226|0x0065A5A2|I appreciate your concern for my well being, but you should also be~careful that your slouch doesn't become permanent.
82227|0x0065A623|I appreciate your concern for~my well being, but you should~also be careful that your~slouch doesn't become
82228|0x0065A6B8|No need to worry. I'm quite like you in that I act and conduct myself~the same at any given time.
82229|0x0065A724|No need to worry. I'm quite~like you in that I act and~conduct myself the same at any~given time.
82230|0x0065A7AF|...And that is exactly what I'm concerned about.
82231|0x0065A7EA|...And that is exactly what I'm~concerned about.
82232|0x0065A844|Okay then, let's hear your regular report.
82233|0x0065A879|Okay then, let's hear your~regular report.
82234|0x0065A8CD|...As you wish.
82235|0x0065A8E7|...As you wish.
82236|0x0065A926|My first matter of importance is the shinigami of the lookout. Similar~to what I reported to you the other day, she seems to be of the same~kind as Hisakaki Kosame.
82237|0x0065A9D5|My first matter of importance~is the shinigami of the~lookout. Similar to what I~reported to you the other day,
82238|0x0065AA6E|Didn't you say you'd be leaving her alone?
82239|0x0065AAA3|Didn't you say you'd be leaving~her alone?
82240|0x0065AAF7|All I merely said was that the need to eradicate her only arises if~she poses a hindrance to sending Hisakaki Kosame back.
82241|0x0065AB7C|All I merely said was that the~need to eradicate her only~arises if she poses a hindrance~to sending Hisakaki Kosame
82242|0x0065AC1A|Well, yeah, if she's got nothing to do with Kosame, it's not your job~to take care of her.
82243|0x0065AC7F|Well, yeah, if she's got~nothing to do with Kosame, it's~not your job to take care of~her.
82244|0x0065AD03|Exactly.
82245|0x0065AD16|Exactly.
82246|0x0065AD48|Or what, did you actually find a connection between them?
82247|0x0065AD8C|Or what, did you actually find~a connection between them?
82248|0x0065ADEF|At present, not that I can see.
82249|0x0065AE19|At present, not that I can see.
82250|0x0065AE62|Should be fine just ignoring her then.
82251|0x0065AE93|Should be fine just ignoring~her then.
82252|0x0065AEE3|I had planned to inquire with the main shrine regarding how to~proceed. I brought up the matter since I believed you ought to know~about it...
82253|0x0065AF7C|I had planned to inquire with~the main shrine regarding how~to proceed. I brought up the~matter since I believed you
82254|0x0065B01A|Ah yeah, they also said ignoring her is perfectly cool.
82255|0x0065B05C|Ah yeah, they also said~ignoring her is perfectly cool.
82256|0x0065B0BD|...Th-They did now?
82257|0x0065B0DB|...Th-They did now?
82258|0x0065B118|Yep. I went ahead and asked 'em about it.
82259|0x0065B14C|Yep. I went ahead and asked 'em~about it.
82260|0x0065B19F|...Can I trust that?
82261|0x0065B1BE|...Can I trust that?
82262|0x0065B1FC|Why wouldn't you believe me?
82263|0x0065B223|Why wouldn't you believe me?
82264|0x0065B269|Telling me to trust your word would be far more unreasonable.
82265|0x0065B2B1|Telling me to trust your word~would be far more unreasonable.
82266|0x0065B318|Since another contumacious deity besides Hisakaki Kosame has been~discovered, even if it is not my duty to take care of her, it's very~near certain that another shrine maiden will be dispatched to~subjugate her.
82267|0x0065B3F6|Since another contumacious~deity besides Hisakaki Kosame~has been discovered, even if it~is not my duty to take care of
82268|0x0065B497|But Kosame isn't really a contumacious deity, to be precise.
82269|0x0065B4DE|But Kosame isn't really a~contumacious deity, to be~precise.
82270|0x0065B544|If she is an Astral Spirit an Astral Deity is granting its light, then~I'd say there is hardly anything wrong with thinking of her as one~anyway.
82271|0x0065B5E0|If she is an Astral Spirit an~Astral Deity is granting its~light, then I'd say there is~hardly anything wrong with
82272|0x0065B67C|In the majority of cases, Astral Spirits born through spiritual~summoning appear in human form, yet appear invisible to the eyes of~normal people.
82273|0x0065B719|In the majority of cases,~Astral Spirits born through~spiritual summoning appear in~human form, yet appear
82274|0x0065B79F|And even in the event that people can actually see them, it would be~limited to nights where the stars shine their light.
82275|0x0065B823|And even in the event that~people can actually see them,~it would be limited to nights~where the stars shine their
82276|0x0065B8BF|All of the instances in lore where Astral Spirits are said to've~blended into human society are also all limited to nighttime, yeah.
82277|0x0065B94E|All of the instances in lore~where Astral Spirits are said~to've blended into human~society are also all limited to
82278|0x0065B9EB|Yet in spite of that, Kosame is leading a life absolutely identical to~all other humans around her...
82279|0x0065BA5B|Yet in spite of that, Kosame is~leading a life absolutely~identical to all other humans~around her...
82280|0x0065BAEA|She can live a perfectly normal life even without the need for sleep~or food.
82281|0x0065BB42|She can live a perfectly normal~life even without the need for~sleep or food.
82282|0x0065BBAB|...You're right. I do suppose calling her a deity wouldn't be too far~off, taking that into account.
82283|0x0065BC1A|...You're right. I do suppose~calling her a deity wouldn't be~too far off, taking that into~account.
82284|0x0065BCA8|I reckon that's how the main shrine sees it, at least.
82285|0x0065BCE9|I reckon that's how the main~shrine sees it, at least.
82286|0x0065BD49|So anyway, regarding that shinigami of the lookout, or whatever you~called her? If that girl really is a contumacious deity, her host~object's got to be somewhere.
82287|0x0065BDF7|So anyway, regarding that~shinigami of the lookout, or~whatever you called her? If~that girl really is a
82288|0x0065BE89|But we haven't found a single thing that'd fit the bill. It can't be~Seitengu's object of worship, since that's already Kosame's host.
82289|0x0065BF1A|But we haven't found a single~thing that'd fit the bill. It~can't be Seitengu's object of~worship, since that's already
82290|0x0065BFBB|Even if you did send her back, there'd be no point at all to it if you~didn't find and enshrine her host object.
82291|0x0065C036|Even if you did send her back,~there'd be no point at all to~it if you didn't find and~enshrine her host object.
82292|0x0065C0C2|All you'd be doing is quelling her temporarily. After a few hundred~years she'd be back up again like nothing happened.
82293|0x0065C144|All you'd be doing is quelling~her temporarily. After a few~hundred years she'd be back up~again like nothing happened.
82294|0x0065C1E5|We both know that permanent sealing is impossible with Seitengu's~powers. But still, I can't bring myself to accept that as a reason why~she should be left at large.
82295|0x0065C295|We both know that permanent~sealing is impossible with~Seitengu's powers. But still, I~can't bring myself to accept
82296|0x0065C332|I never said that. However, at present she doesn't seem to be out to~cause harm.
82297|0x0065C38D|I never said that. However, at~present she doesn't seem to be~out to cause harm.
82298|0x0065C407|...But we can't wait until she's already brought about harm to take~action.
82299|0x0065C45D|...But we can't wait until~she's already brought about~harm to take action.
82300|0x0065C4D2|Well, look, I'll handle the matter with that lookout shinigami. What~you need to be focusing on now is your own task.
82301|0x0065C552|Well, look, I'll handle the~matter with that lookout~shinigami. What you need to be~focusing on now is your own
82302|0x0065C5DD|That's an order from your superior.
82303|0x0065C60B|That's an order from your~superior.
82304|0x0065C658|...Understood.
82305|0x0065C671|...Understood.
82306|0x0065C6A9|Let's move on then.
82307|0x0065C6C7|Let's move on then.
82308|0x0065C704|Of course. I believe you are already aware of the fact, but it would~appear Hisakaki Komomo has started to have nightmares.
82309|0x0065C78A|Of course. I believe you are~already aware of the fact, but~it would appear Hisakaki Komomo~has started to have nightmares.
82310|0x0065C82F|Yeah. I've heard her and Kosame talking about it a few times.
82311|0x0065C877|Yeah. I've heard her and Kosame~talking about it a few times.
82312|0x0065C8DE|The trigger appears to be Hisakaki Komomo having entered the lookout.
82313|0x0065C92E|The trigger appears to be~Hisakaki Komomo having entered~the lookout.
82314|0x0065C99D|It'd have to be.
82315|0x0065C9B8|It'd have to be.
82316|0x0065C9F2|So...
82317|0x0065CA02|So...
82318|0x0065CA31|Let me guess. You want permission to send Kosame back, yeah?
82319|0x0065CA78|Let me guess. You want~permission to send Kosame back,~yeah?
82320|0x0065CADE|......
82321|0x0065CAEF|......
82322|0x0065CB1F|Something wrong?
82323|0x0065CB3A|Something wrong?
82324|0x0065CB74|...No, nothing.
82325|0x0065CB8E|...No, nothing.
82326|0x0065CBE8|I think it's only a matter of time before Komomo remembers everything.~Now that the nightmare that haunted her in the past is back, we're~only counting down the days.
82327|0x0065CC99|I think it's only a matter of~time before Komomo remembers~everything. Now that the~nightmare that haunted her in
82328|0x0065CD34|As such, I hereby order you to send Kosame back.
82329|0x0065CD6F|As such, I hereby order you to~send Kosame back.
82330|0x0065CDBB|Put her to rest, like Kosame herself wishes for.
82331|0x0065CDF6|Put her to rest, like Kosame~herself wishes for.
82332|0x0065CE42|There's no doubt in my mind that Komomo will be able to accept that~reality for what it is, without averting her eyes.
82333|0x0065CEC3|There's no doubt in my mind~that Komomo will be able to~accept that reality for what it~is, without averting her eyes.
82334|0x0065CF63|Sending her back should settle everything once and for all.
82335|0x0065CFA9|Sending her back should settle~everything once and for all.
82336|0x0065D02A|......
82337|0x0065D03B|......
82338|0x0065D06B|You don't seem happy with that.
82339|0x0065D095|You don't seem happy with that.
82340|0x0065D0DE|...That isn't the case.
82341|0x0065D100|...That isn't the case.
82342|0x0065D141|It's not like your attitude is making me say this, but I'll add a~little something.
82343|0x0065D19F|It's not like your attitude is~making me say this, but I'll~add a little something.
82344|0x0065D21C|Should my daughters find a different answer...
82345|0x0065D255|Should my daughters find a~different answer...
82346|0x0065D29F|Should they realize that Kosame returning to the stars is not the only~possibility there is...
82347|0x0065D308|Should they realize that Kosame~returning to the stars is not~the only possibility there~is...

82354|0x0065D521|I believe I can entrust you with that.

82366|0x0065D7FB|She made that decision with her sister in mind.

82382|0x0065DFA3|Yep. We get ourselves a nice beautiful harvest moon in September,~after all.
82383|0x0065DFFA|Yep. We get ourselves a nice~beautiful harvest moon in~September, after all.
82384|0x0065E060|Don't tell me you're thinking of going with moon-viewing as our~program for the Hibari Festival?

82386|0x0065E18C|Of course not. Besides, Hibari Festival is next month.
82387|0x0065E1CD|Of course not. Besides, Hibari~Festival is next month.
82388|0x0065E22D|What I was getting at is that it might be a nice idea to hold a~moon-viewing party on our next stargazing session.

82394|0x0065E532|Wasn't the Mid-Autumn Festival on the 15th of August in the old~calendar?
82395|0x0065E586|Wasn't the Mid-Autumn Festival~on the 15th of August in the~old calendar?
82396|0x0065E5F9|Huh? But it's the 15th of September when translated to the modern~calendar, right?
82397|0x0065E656|Huh? But it's the 15th of~September when translated to~the modern calendar, right?
82398|0x0065E6F7|The old and modern calendar differ in the total amount of days in a~year. Hence the exact date changes around every year.

82400|0x0065E83A|...Then when is the Mid-Autumn Festival?

82402|0x0065E8BF|I'd have to look it up to be for certain, but I believe we should be~having a full moon next weekend.

82404|0x0065E9ED|Huh? Doesn't the full moon line up with the Mid-Autumn Festival?
82405|0x0065EA38|Huh? Doesn't the full moon line~up with the Mid-Autumn~Festival?
82406|0x0065EABE|Nope. The Mid-Autumn Festival doesn't necessarily have to have a full~moon. There are also years with a few days of mismatch.

82412|0x0065ED4D|Kosame-san had been staying out of the conversation for a while now.
82413|0x0065ED9C|Kosame-san had been staying out~of the conversation for a while~now.
82414|0x0065EE10|You guys don't do moon-viewing in your family, Kosame-san?

82416|0x0065EEB9|...Oh, yes, about that.
82417|0x0065EEDB|...Oh, yes, about that.
82418|0x0065EF10|She responded after a slight delay.
82419|0x0065EF3E|She responded after a slight~delay.
82420|0x0065EF8B|We have never done a moon-viewing party. Our shrine reveres the stars,~not the moon, so it only makes sense I suppose.
82421|0x0065F00C|We have never done a~moon-viewing party. Our shrine~reveres the stars, not the~moon, so it only makes sense I
82422|0x0065F0BF|I hear there are but a few shrines that worship the moon in the first~place, and besides that, I'd assume you won't find many normal~families that do moon-viewing either.

82426|0x0065F351|We don't do moon-viewing at my place either, but we do put a special~dish relating to the Mid-Autumn Festival on the menu every year.

82428|0x0065F474|What kinda dish?
82429|0x0065F48F|What kinda dish?
82430|0x0065F4C9|Hecate's Sorcery.
82431|0x0065F4E5|Hecate's Sorcery.
82432|0x0065F510|...Well okay, but like, what exactly is that?
82433|0x0065F548|...Well okay, but like, what~exactly is that?
82434|0x0065F59F|Well, the dumplings that go with moon-viewing of course.
82435|0x0065F5E2|Well, the dumplings that go~with moon-viewing of course.
82436|0x0065F62A|That dish name doesn't tell you anything about the actual dish.
82437|0x0065F674|That dish name doesn't tell you~anything about the actual dish.
82438|0x0065F6DD|Hecate is the goddess of the full moon and she's also the ruler of the~night. She's apparently super smart, unrivaled in sorcery, and was~worshipped by countless witches in ancient times.
82439|0x0065F7A3|Hecate is the goddess of the~full moon and she's also the~ruler of the night. She's~apparently super smart,
82440|0x0065F81E|Honestly, that didn't really fit my image of Japanese moon-viewing.
82441|0x0065F86C|Honestly, that didn't really~fit my image of Japanese~moon-viewing.
82442|0x0065F8F3|...I believe Artemis is the one that usually comes to mind when you~talk about myths pertaining the moon.
82443|0x0065F967|...I believe Artemis is the one~that usually comes to mind when~you talk about myths pertaining~the moon.
82444|0x0065F9FA|You're right about that, but Artemis symbolizes the crescent or new~moon. When you talk about the Goddess of the full moon, that's Hecate.
82445|0x0065FA8F|You're right about that, but~Artemis symbolizes the crescent~or new moon. When you talk~about the Goddess of the full
82446|0x0065FB2E|A cool fact about Artemis is that she's known around for being the~goddess that brings about sudden death.
82447|0x0065FBA3|A cool fact about Artemis is~that she's known around for~being the goddess that brings~about sudden death.
82448|0x0065FC37|...That doesn't match my image of her.
82449|0x0065FC68|...That doesn't match my image~of her.
82450|0x0065FCA8|Yeah. When I hear Artemis, the first thing that comes to mind is a~bow.
82451|0x0065FCFA|Yeah. When I hear Artemis, the~first thing that comes to mind~is a bow.
82452|0x0065FD89|Well, that's because she's more often referred to as the goddess of~the hunt and chastity.
82453|0x0065FDEE|Well, that's because she's more~often referred to as the~goddess of the hunt and~chastity.
82454|0x0065FE8E|However, these gods and goddesses related to the moon also symbolize~death and darkness. I imagine the night must have been a symbol of~fear to people back before we had electricity.

82743|0x00665C30|Ah, yeah, that's probably best.~We'll be able to relax and~enjoy the party more that way.
82744|0x00665CA3|Could we maybe make the moon-viewing party itself optional?

82748|0x00665DD3|Hmm, not really, but with a moon-viewing party on top of our usual~stargazing, we might be there a little long. I don't wanna stay out~all too late and worry Shino-san.

82786|0x00666B62|...Err, I just said it wasn't you.
82787|0x00666B8F|...Err, I just said it wasn't~you.
82788|0x00666BDB|If I alone had opposed it, I would've trampled on the rest of the~members' excitement for it. So for the Astro Club's sake, you took the~middle ground and proposed to make it optional.

82837|0x00667AF8|You should know that there are~some things you ought not to~say even as a joke.
82838|0x00667B61|You mean, sort of like jinxing things?
82839|0x00667B92|You mean, sort of like jinxing~things?
82840|0x00667BE2|Exactly. Things would become really problematic if that came to be~true by some accidental turn of event.
82841|0x00667C56|Exactly. Things would become~really problematic if that came~to be true by some accidental~turn of event.
82842|0x00667CCF|I guess because she would say she didn't have the right.
82843|0x00667D12|I guess because she would say~she didn't have the right.
82844|0x00667D64|But there's nothing wrong with saying that I love you as a friend,~right?
82845|0x00667DB8|But there's nothing wrong with~saying that I love you as a~friend, right?

82871|0x00668409|So anyway, I take it you won't~participate in the moon-viewing~party?
82872|0x00668478|...Yes, that's the plan.

82878|0x0066859F|She struggled to answer.
82879|0x006685C2|She struggled to answer.
82880|0x006685F4|Does it have to do with you saying you'll change upon seeing the full~moon?
82881|0x0066864A|Does it have to do with you~saying you'll change upon~seeing the full moon?
82882|0x006686BF|...Exactly.

82887|0x00668795|During the stargazing session,~I would almost certainly also~end up changing...
82888|0x00668800|Just by standing beneath the full moon, I undergo a very troublesome~transformation.
82889|0x0066885F|Just by standing beneath the~full moon, I undergo a very~troublesome transformation.
82890|0x006688CD|You've kinda gotten me curious to see what this change is.
82891|0x00668912|You've kinda gotten me curious~to see what this change is.
82892|0x00668976|If you did, you would transform as well.

82894|0x006689EB|I'd change after seeing your changed form?

82900|0x00668AEE|You would become a dirty-minded werewolf.
82901|0x00668B22|You would become a dirty-minded~werewolf.
82902|0x00668B65|Do I even ask why or how or what that even means...
82903|0x00668BA3|Do I even ask why or how or~what that even means...
82904|0x00668C00|Well, it simply means you would assume an exceedingly troublesome~attitude towards me.
82905|0x00668C61|Well, it simply means you would~assume an exceedingly~troublesome attitude towards~me.
82906|0x00668CD1|Like what would I do?
82907|0x00668CF1|Like what would I do?
82908|0x00668D30|Things werewolf-like predatory men would do.

82913|0x00668E33|...Do I really have to say it?
82914|0x00668E6B|You're always saying that kind of stuff of your own accord, you~know...
82915|0x00668EBD|You're always saying that kind~of stuff of your own accord,~you know...
82916|0x00668F2E|Then don't specifically ask.

82924|0x006690F4|It's actually a little bit different.
82925|0x00669124|It's actually a little bit~different.

82932|0x006692D2|So I would lose my mind by seeing you?
82933|0x00669303|So I would lose my mind by~seeing you?
82934|0x00669353|Exactly.
82935|0x00669366|Exactly.

82940|0x00669468|Can't see that being possible.
82941|0x00669491|Can't see that being possible.
82942|0x006694D9|How can you be so sure?
82943|0x006694FB|How can you be so sure?
82944|0x0066952C|'Cause I'm a gentleman.

82948|0x0066963C|You can bet on it.

82950|0x006696BD|Take that!
82951|0x006696D2|Take that!
82952|0x00669726|Why...

82981|0x00669F04|By demon, do you mean the kinds~you often see driven away and~stuff in folklore and~mythology?
82982|0x00669F8C|Yes. Demons are existences that we humans oppose and fight. They get~quelled as contumacious existences, and are sent back to where they~came from.

83462|0x006734DD|Kosame-san still had the incident with Mare fresh in her mind, so that~might've been thoughtless of me.

83738|0x006787D5|The spot where she'd gotten hit was red and swollen.

83740|0x006788A4|That... startled me...
83741|0x006788C5|That... startled me...
83742|0x006788EB|Kosame-san wasn't touching the the burn on the back of her hand,~instead gripping the wrist of that hand as she endured the pain.

83744|0x00678A06|Kosame-san, can you walk?
83745|0x00678A2A|Kosame-san, can you walk?
83746|0x00678A53|I asked her with my arm put around her. We had to treat her burn right~away.
83747|0x00678AAA|I asked her with my arm put~around her. We had to treat her~burn right away.
83748|0x00678B10|If it's too difficult for you, I'll go get some water.
83749|0x00678B51|If it's too difficult for you,~I'll go get some water.
83750|0x00678BB1|I-I can... It's not a serious burn...
83751|0x00678BE1|I-I can... It's not a serious~burn...
83752|0x00678C16|It sure didn't look like that to me. It likely wasn't just one of the~twigs that hit her as a rather large surface was swollen.

83756|0x00678DDC|Y-You can... let go of my shoulder...
83757|0x00678E0C|Y-You can... let go of my~shoulder...
83758|0x00678E4B|...Look, don't be worrying about me at a time like this.

83760|0x00678EE2|B-But...

83774|0x00679205|Just be a good girl and let me treat you. Simple, right?
83775|0x00679248|Just be a good girl and let me~treat you. Simple, right?
83776|0x006792AA|......
83777|0x006792BB|......
83778|0x006792DD|That isn't... simple to me at all...
83779|0x0067930C|That isn't... simple to me at~all...
83780|0x0067934A|Then just hang in there. Put up with it even if it stings.
83781|0x0067938F|Then just hang in there. Put up~with it even if it stings.
83782|0x006793E5|I didn't mean it... like that...

83788|0x006794C6|From my perspective, there's no difference.
83789|0x006794FC|From my perspective, there's no~difference.
83790|0x00679537|The reason Kosame-san was being more reserved than necessary.
83791|0x0067957F|The reason Kosame-san was being~more reserved than necessary.
83792|0x006795CC|No matter what that reason was, it didn't change this ensuing feeling~of loneliness.
83793|0x0067962B|No matter what that reason was,~it didn't change this ensuing~feeling of loneliness.
83794|0x0067970E|...Thank you very much, Kogasaka-san.
83795|0x0067973E|...Thank you very much,~Kogasaka-san.

83799|0x00679856|Well, thanks to you, it doesn't~hurt anymore.
83800|0x00679893|I only cooled it and did some basic first aid such as applying a~gauze, that's all. While the pain may have subsided to some extent, it~certainly hadn't gone away.

83805|0x00679ABF|I'm sorry you had to do all of~this for me.
83806|0x00679B05|She directed a bow at me.
83807|0x00679B29|She directed a bow at me.
83808|0x00679B6C|You seem like you're used to giving first aid.
83809|0x00679BA5|You seem like you're used to~giving first aid.
83810|0x00679BED|Well, I used to have to deal with my sister constantly wreaking havoc~and getting hurt.
83811|0x00679C4F|Well, I used to have to deal~with my sister constantly~wreaking havoc and getting~hurt.
83812|0x00679CD0|You're such a good brother.

83814|0x00679D2B|More importantly, you'd better go to the hospital.
83815|0x00679D68|More importantly, you'd better~go to the hospital.
83816|0x00679DC4|It's already evening, and it really doesn't hurt anymore.
83817|0x00679E08|It's already evening, and it~really doesn't hurt anymore.
83818|0x00679E5B|You need to get it treated properly, or you might end up with a scar.~If it's too late today, then let's go tomorrow.
83819|0x00679EDB|You need to get it treated~properly, or you might end up~with a scar. If it's too late~today, then let's go tomorrow.

83821|0x00679FAD|No, that's all right. It's~already fine.
83822|0x00679FEF|...Kosame-san, you need to treat your skin with more care.
83823|0x0067A034|...Kosame-san, you need to~treat your skin with more care.
83824|0x0067A098|Why?
83825|0x0067A0A7|Why?
83826|0x0067A0C5|Well, it's that pretty.
83827|0x0067A0E7|Well, it's that pretty.
83828|0x0067A128|...Are you planning to assault me now?
83829|0x0067A159|...Are you planning to assault~me now?
83830|0x0067A199|I'm being serious.
83831|0x0067A1B6|I'm being serious.
83832|0x0067A1E6|Kosame-san cast her eyes down.
83833|0x0067A20F|Kosame-san cast her eyes down.
83834|0x0067A257|...Kogasaka-san. The thing is, I have a body that doesn't get scars~from injuries.
83835|0x0067A2B4|...Kogasaka-san. The thing is,~I have a body that doesn't get~scars from injuries.
83836|0x0067A320|Look, I said I'm being serious here, so...
83837|0x0067A355|Look, I said I'm being serious~here, so...
83838|0x0067A3A9|I'm serious too. I mean it when I say that the pain is gone, and the~burn itself will also be gone after a short while.
83839|0x0067A42B|I'm serious too. I mean it when~I say that the pain is gone,~and the burn itself will also~be gone after a short while.
83840|0x0067A4BE|Supposing there had been no fire in front of me, and I hadn't known~where those burnt twigs had come flying from...
83841|0x0067A53C|Supposing there had been no~fire in front of me, and I~hadn't known where those burnt~twigs had come flying from...
83842|0x0067A5DF|Then I think I wouldn't have gotten burned at all.
83843|0x0067A61C|Then I think I wouldn't have~gotten burned at all.
83844|0x0067A65E|Her words transcended my comprehension.
83845|0x0067A690|Her words transcended my~comprehension.
83846|0x0067A6E7|The reason I got burned is that I assumed the fire to be hot, coupled~with the knowledge that I touched fire.
83847|0x0067A75F|The reason I got burned is that~I assumed the fire to be hot,~coupled with the knowledge that~I touched fire.
83848|0x0067A7F6|So in the event that I don't realize that I've touched fire, I won't~feel any heat.
83849|0x0067A854|So in the event that I don't~realize that I've touched fire,~I won't feel any heat.
83850|0x0067A8C3|And even if I did feel heat, by convincing myself that it doesn't~hurt, and I don't have a burn, I won't get injured.
83851|0x0067A943|And even if I did feel heat, by~convincing myself that it~doesn't hurt, and I don't have~a burn, I won't get injured.

83856|0x0067ABD2|Which means...

83858|0x0067AC43|Which means, I can even do something like this.
83859|0x0067AC7D|Which means, I can even do~something like this.
83860|0x0067ACC8|I can grip it with my bare hand without feeling any pain.
83861|0x0067AD0C|I can grip it with my bare hand~without feeling any pain.
83862|0x0067AD61|It won't hurt, I won't get injured. Just by believing that I won't, it~takes form and becomes reality.
83863|0x0067ADD2|It won't hurt, I won't get~injured. Just by believing that~I won't, it takes form and~becomes reality.
83864|0x0067AEA9|There exists an interpretation of quantum mechanics that states things~only have a definite existence after they're observed. Me not getting~injured might operate under that same principle.
83865|0x0067AF71|There exists an interpretation~of quantum mechanics that~states things only have a~definite existence after
83866|0x0067AFF8|Of course it is only one interpretation of the quantum theory, but the~important part is that it's an idea that transcends the physical laws~that bind humans.

83892|0x0067B79F|...It started to hurt now because you pointed it out.
83893|0x0067B7DF|...It started to hurt now~because you pointed it out.
83894|0x0067B824|I still couldn't tell how serious she was about that.
83895|0x0067B864|I still couldn't tell how~serious she was about that.

83918|0x0067BE95|On top of the table was a mountain of freshly made roasted sweet~potatoes. While I was treating Kosame-san, Mayaka-san was nice enough~to to go and fetch them for us.
83919|0x0067BF46|On top of the table was a~mountain of freshly made~roasted sweet potatoes. While I~was treating Kosame-san,
83920|0x0067BFC1|The aluminum foil had cooled down by now, so it was the perfect time~to eat them.
83921|0x0067C01D|The aluminum foil had cooled~down by now, so it was the~perfect time to eat them.
83922|0x0067C0B8|...Kosame-san, can you eat with that hand?

84718|0x0068A706|Am I...

84720|0x0068A72F|Kosame-san's tone was insecure.
84721|0x0068A759|Kosame-san's tone was insecure.
84722|0x0068A7A1|Am I acting out the role of your girlfriend properly...?
84723|0x0068A7E4|Am I acting out the role of~your girlfriend properly...?
84724|0x0068A82C|Forget about her, I was the one seriously worrying about whether I was~pulling my role off decently.
84725|0x0068A89B|Forget about her, I was the one~seriously worrying about~whether I was pulling my role~off decently.
84726|0x0068A91B|I wonder how others would see us...
84727|0x0068A949|I wonder how others would see~us...
84728|0x0068A986|Probably a normal couple, wouldn't you think?
84729|0x0068A9BE|Probably a normal couple,~wouldn't you think?
84730|0x0068AA07|They would now...?
84731|0x0068AA24|They would now...?
84732|0x0068AA50|I'd bet on it.
84733|0x0068AA69|I'd bet on it.
84734|0x0068AA93|I'll take you for your word then, okay...?
84735|0x0068AAC8|I'll take you for your word~then, okay...?
84736|0x0068AB0C|Yeah, do that.
84737|0x0068AB25|Yeah, do that.
84738|0x0068AB4F|What will you do if someone tells us we don't look like one...?
84739|0x0068AB99|What will you do if someone~tells us we don't look like~one...?
84740|0x0068ABF2|Well, whoever that person is, I'd say they've got something wrong with~their eyes.
84741|0x0068AC4F|Well, whoever that person is,~I'd say they've got something~wrong with their eyes.
84742|0x0068ACBD|I wouldn't be so sure...
84743|0x0068ACE0|I wouldn't be so sure...
84744|0x0068AD12|Because I don't look fitting next to you?
84745|0x0068AD46|Because I don't look fitting~next to you?
84746|0x0068AD98|...Not at all.
84747|0x0068ADB1|...Not at all.
84748|0x0068ADCF|Kosame-san shook her head.
84749|0x0068ADF4|Kosame-san shook her head.
84750|0x0068AE2A|It would rather be me who doesn't fit...
84751|0x0068AE5D|It would rather be me who~doesn't fit...
84752|0x0068AE9F|Well, other people's perspectives are irrelevant. As long as I love~you, and you love me, that's all that matters. We're a couple.

84754|0x0068AFB1|......
84755|0x0068AFC2|......
84756|0x0068AFE2|That is why we're on a date, right?
84757|0x0068B010|That is why we're on a date,~right?
84758|0x0068B043|Although I didn't know whether the right to go on a date with me was~an equal trade-off for the sweet potatoes she gave me.
84759|0x0068B0C9|Although I didn't know whether~the right to go on a date with~me was an equal trade-off for~the sweet potatoes she gave me.
84760|0x0068B154|Tension escaped from Kosame-san's shoulders.

84762|0x0068B1E0|Nothing makes me happier than hearing that...
84763|0x0068B218|Nothing makes me happier than~hearing that...
84764|0x0068B261|I guess even I can be in a relationship if it's just pretend...
84765|0x0068B2AB|I guess even I can be in a~relationship if it's just~pretend...
84766|0x0068B2FA|Though I think she could be in a real relationship just fine, if she~allowed herself.
84767|0x0068B35A|Though I think she could be in~a real relationship just fine,~if she allowed herself.
84768|0x0068B3BF|Someone like her would have no trouble finding a boyfriend. The guy~who could have her as his girlfriend would be one lucky son of a gun.
84769|0x0068B453|Someone like her would have no~trouble finding a boyfriend.~The guy who could have her as~his girlfriend would be one
84770|0x0068B4D8|But I guess if I said that out loud, to her it would only sound like I~was teasing her.
84771|0x0068B53A|But I guess if I said that out~loud, to her it would only~sound like I was teasing her.
84772|0x0068B5AB|Let's go.
84773|0x0068B5BF|Let's go.
84774|0x0068B610|...Yes.
84775|0x0068B622|...Yes.
84776|0x0068B639|I slowly stepped forth.
84777|0x0068B65B|I slowly stepped forth.
84778|0x0068B69B|You know... this is the first time ever I've linked arms with~someone...
84779|0x0068B6EE|You know... this is the first~time ever I've linked arms with~someone...
84780|0x0068B750|Same here.
84781|0x0068B765|Same here.
84782|0x0068B78B|...Really now?
84783|0x0068B7A4|...Really now?
84784|0x0068B7CC|Why would I need to lie?
84785|0x0068B7EF|Why would I need to lie?
84786|0x0068B823|...True.
84787|0x0068B836|...True.
84788|0x0068B84E|Kosame-san nodded gleefully.
84789|0x0068B875|Kosame-san nodded gleefully.
84790|0x0068B8A1|Thus the two of us walked on at a leisurely pace.
84791|0x0068B8DD|Thus the two of us walked on at~a leisurely pace.
84792|0x0068B95E|After walking a little ways, a tasteful sight sprang into our eyes.

84794|0x0068BA34|Huh... so this is the waterway.
84795|0x0068BA5E|Huh... so this is the waterway.
84796|0x0068BACC|That it is. Your first time seeing it?
84797|0x0068BAFD|That it is. Your first time~seeing it?
84798|0x0068BB3D|Yeah. Though I did know it existed.
84799|0x0068BB6B|Yeah. Though I did know it~existed.
84800|0x0068BB9E|It was one of Hibarigasaki's sight-seeing spots. Yet, even so, I~hadn't visited it back during my childhood here.

84802|0x0068BCA7|Once you exit this bridge on the other side, you're already in the~neighboring town. If you then follow the road further ahead a fair~while, you'll come across the hospital my dad works at.

84804|0x0068BE1F|Back when Hisakaki had received her hand injury, and Kosame-san was~blacked out, we rode there in Shino-san's car.

84806|0x0068BF1E|Maybe we did pass over this bridge, but either way I wouldn't have~known. At that time I was so worried about Hisakaki and Kosame-san, I~didn't pay any attention to where we were.
84807|0x0068BFDC|Maybe we did pass over this~bridge, but either way I~wouldn't have known. At that~time I was so worried about
84808|0x0068C096|The wind feels so nice, don't you think...
84809|0x0068C0CB|The wind feels so nice, don't~you think...
84810|0x0068C105|The cool breeze gliding over the waterway rustled Kosame-san's long~hair, making it stroke my shoulder.

84815|0x0068C315|Each time, Kosame-san put more~strength into her arm.
84816|0x0068C364|I guess it's the uniforms, huh. We don't much look like a tourist~couple.
84817|0x0068C3B8|I guess it's the uniforms, huh.~We don't much look like a~tourist couple.
84818|0x0068C42B|...Right.
84819|0x0068C43F|...Right.
84820|0x0068C462|But I'm positive we look like a Hibari High couple.

84822|0x0068C4FD|......
84823|0x0068C50E|......
84824|0x0068C524|Through her arm, I could feel her shaking slightly.
84825|0x0068C562|Through her arm, I could feel~her shaking slightly.
84826|0x0068C5BF|...A ghost's romance.

84828|0x0068C604|She murmured beneath her breath.

84830|0x0068C669|Huh?
84831|0x0068C678|Huh?
84832|0x0068C6A6|It comes up fairly often, right? Romance stories with a ghost.
84833|0x0068C6EF|It comes up fairly often,~right? Romance stories with a~ghost.
84834|0x0068C749|The partner dies in an accident or something and becomes a ghost...~or, in other examples, the person the main character fell in love with~turned out to be a ghost all along...

84848|0x0068CD1E|Yes?
84849|0x0068CD2D|Yes?
84850|0x0068CD4B|Like for example the ghost that went to Heaven reincarnating and they~meet again, or they meet up again after the guy dies, stuff like that~doesn't work?

84864|0x0068D224|The ghost's time left on Earth is ticking down...
84865|0x0068D260|The ghost's time left on Earth~is ticking down...
