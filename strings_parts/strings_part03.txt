15372|0x0017A889|Oh, and if you want, I'll introduce my sister to you some time soon.
15373|0x0017A8D8|Oh, and if you want, I'll~introduce my sister to you some~time soon.
15374|0x0017A96C|You better! We have a deal on that. And I'm sure as heck not gonna~forget about it.
15375|0x0017A9CA|You better! We have a deal on~that. And I'm sure as heck not~gonna forget about it.
15376|0x0017AA2D|(...Maybe I should have thought that through.)

15380|0x0017ABB2|Where is the Astro Club's club room?
15381|0x0017ABE1|Where is the Astro Club's club~room?
15382|0x0017AC48|On the second floor. The floor where all the specialized rooms are~located.

15384|0x0017AD03|It's not in the club building?
15385|0x0017AD2C|It's not in the club building?
15386|0x0017AD5A|I'd heard that they have a separate building near the gym that is used~exclusively for clubs.
15387|0x0017ADC2|I'd heard that they have a~separate building near the gym~that is used exclusively for~clubs.
15388|0x0017AE66|Only athletic groups have access to the club building. By default, any~clubs of an academic nature need to borrow one of the specialized~classrooms to use as their club room.

15392|0x0017B0B9|And the Astro Club?
15393|0x0017B0D7|And the Astro Club?
15394|0x0017B0FA|Asuho and Kosame-san glanced at each other, and then a pained look~creeped onto their faces.
15395|0x0017B161|Asuho and Kosame-san glanced at~each other, and then a pained~look creeped onto their faces.
15396|0x0017B1ED|Normally, fan clubs aren't even allowed to have a club room, but,~well...
15397|0x0017B241|Normally, fan clubs aren't even~allowed to have a club room,~but, well...
15398|0x0017B2B4|That doesn't apply to us! Perks of the Astro Club's long history here~at Hibari High, I guess you could say!

15400|0x0017B3C1|The Astro Club has been downgraded to a fan club due to a lack of~members, but it still retains its club room.
15401|0x0017B43A|The Astro Club has been~downgraded to a fan club due to~a lack of members, but it still~retains its club room.
15402|0x0017B4C2|So basically, the Astro Club's getting special treatment compared to~the other fan clubs?
15403|0x0017B526|So basically, the Astro Club's~getting special treatment~compared to the other fan~clubs?
15404|0x0017B5A9|It's not entirely correct to say that, actually. You have essentially~two factions that the teachers are split into. One that favors~preserving the Astro Club, and the other that wants it abolished.

15408|0x0017B7DB|That topic got Asuho in a huff.
15409|0x0017B805|That topic got Asuho in a huff.
15410|0x0017B83E|I've actually been curious about this, but do you actually hate~Hisakaki-san, Asuho?

15412|0x0017B91B|Oh, so you know Komomo-chan.

15414|0x0017B978|Well the Student Council did bag searches yesterday, right? That's~when I got the chance to meet her.

15416|0x0017BA5D|Although, technically I met her when she said something to me on the~day I transferred.
15417|0x0017BABF|Although, technically I met her~when she said something to me~on the day I transferred.
15418|0x0017BB26|I don't know whether it's because she wanted to have me join the~Student Council or what, but apparently, she already knew who I was at~the time.
15419|0x0017BBC2|I don't know whether it's~because she wanted to have me~join the Student Council or~what, but apparently, she
15420|0x0017BC59|Hm, rather than hating her, it's more like I hate how she's treating~us like a thorn in her side...
15421|0x0017BCC7|Hm, rather than hating her,~it's more like I hate how she's~treating us like a thorn in her~side...
15422|0x0017BD54|Nee-san has a dislike for stargazing. So, I would suppose that's why~she also dislikes our Astro Club.

15424|0x0017BE45|Why does she hate the stars so much?
15425|0x0017BE74|Why does she hate the stars so~much?
15426|0x0017BEC2|Kogasaka-san, I must advise you, prying into other people's business~is poor manners.
15427|0x0017BF22|Kogasaka-san, I must advise~you, prying into other people's~business is poor manners.
15428|0x0017BF87|I suppose that means she has some circumstances she doesn't want~others to know about.
15429|0x0017BFE8|I suppose that means she has~some circumstances she doesn't~want others to know about.
15430|0x0017C068|I also wanna know that reason myself, but I can't get either of them~to tell me anything.
15431|0x0017C0CC|I also wanna know that reason~myself, but I can't get either~of them to tell me anything.
15432|0x0017C14F|To tell you the truth, I don't know exactly why either.

15434|0x0017C1F2|Oh, so that's why.
15435|0x0017C20F|Oh, so that's why.
15436|0x0017C24B|Nee-san doesn't talk to me about it either. So, I'm terribly sorry,~but...

15438|0x0017C304|Well, you can hardly complain about someone's preferences. I doubt~you'd want someone to criticize you for loving the stars, for~instance.
15439|0x0017C399|Well, you can hardly complain~about someone's preferences. I~doubt you'd want someone to~criticize you for loving the
15440|0x0017C438|Well, duh.
15441|0x0017C44D|Well, duh.
15442|0x0017C471|So then we can't criticize her if she hates stargazing.
15443|0x0017C4B3|So then we can't criticize her~if she hates stargazing.
15444|0x0017C530|Wow... You joined the Astro Club and now you're taking Komomo-chan's~side?
15445|0x0017C585|Wow... You joined the Astro~Club and now you're taking~Komomo-chan's side?
15446|0x0017C5E9|No, no, don't get me wrong here.
15447|0x0017C614|No, no, don't get me wrong~here.
15448|0x0017C66A|How could you! It's all stupid Komomo-chan's fault we're stuck sitting~on our butts all day with nothing to do!
15449|0x0017C6E4|How could you! It's all stupid~Komomo-chan's fault we're stuck~sitting on our butts all day~with nothing to do!
15450|0x0017C76D|Look, calm down. I just said I wasn't. All I mean is that if you wanna~persuade Hisakaki-san, there are ways to convince her even if she does~hate stargazing.
15451|0x0017C816|Look, calm down. I just said I~wasn't. All I mean is that if~you wanna persuade~Hisakaki-san, there are ways to
15452|0x0017C8B5|Like what, for example?
15453|0x0017C8D7|Like what, for example?
15454|0x0017C908|...That I don't know.
15455|0x0017C928|...That I don't know.
15456|0x0017C967|Hmph.
15457|0x0017C977|Hmph.
15458|0x0017C9C2|Looks like your argument was missing the last thing required to~convince Asuho-san.
15459|0x0017CA20|Looks like your argument was~missing the last thing required~to convince Asuho-san.
15460|0x0017CA83|That seems like a lot to ask of a new club member.
15461|0x0017CAC0|That seems like a lot to ask of~a new club member.
15462|0x0017CB4C|I swear! One day, I'll wipe that smug look off Komomo-chan's face and~make her absolutely dumbstruck!

15466|0x0017CD01|All right, here we are! This is our club room.
15467|0x0017CD3A|All right, here we are! This is~our club room.
15468|0x0017CD78|There was a plate over the door which said,  'Audiovisual Room'.

15470|0x0017CE1D|So the Astro Club's always used this room?
15471|0x0017CE52|So the Astro Club's always used~this room?
15472|0x0017CEBA|Yep. When it got downgraded to a fan club, apparently there were tons~of other clubs that asked if they could take the AV room instead.

15474|0x0017D00C|I hear the Film Study Club was especially zealous about it. It's~hardly a surprise when you see the size of the projection screen the~AV room has.

15476|0x0017D14D|Given the situation back then, it actually wouldn't have been strange~if they'd gotten the room instead. It was kinda like, while it does~have a rich history, it simply can't win against the flow of time.
15477|0x0017D224|Given the situation back then,~it actually wouldn't have been~strange if they'd gotten the~room instead. It was kinda
15478|0x0017D2B3|But in the end, you held onto the club room, huh?
15479|0x0017D2EF|But in the end, you held onto~the club room, huh?
15480|0x0017D34A|Yep. Back then our club president, Okaizumi-senpai, was a freshman and~the club's only member...

15484|0x0017D54C|It's like a heroic tale in the annals of our Astro Club's history.
15485|0x0017D599|It's like a heroic tale in the~annals of our Astro Club's~history.
15486|0x0017D605|Yeah. He deserves a medal of honor.
15487|0x0017D633|Yeah. He deserves a medal of~honor.
15488|0x0017D680|I'd rather give him the Nobel Prize for astronomy.
15489|0x0017D6BD|I'd rather give him the Nobel~Prize for astronomy.
15490|0x0017D6FF|Judging by what the two of them said about him, that president must be~an astronomy fan of at least Asuho's caliber.

15496|0x0017D9FD|Got it.
15497|0x0017DA0F|Got it.
15498|0x0017DA26|Honestly, it made me nervous to hear that.
15499|0x0017DA5B|Honestly, it made me nervous to~hear that.
15500|0x0017DAAF|All right then, follow my lead!

15510|0x0017DD7D|I followed the two of them inside and took a quick look around the~room.
15511|0x0017DDD0|I followed the two of them~inside and took a quick look~around the room.
15512|0x0017DE28|The first thing my eyes noticed was, naturally, the large projection~screen. It looked like a huge white wall on the right side.

15514|0x0017DF37|Near that, there was a small whiteboard, and on the lectern in front a~microphone and some other devices were installed. To the left of the~room, there were well-organized rows of long tables and chairs~stretching out.

15518|0x0017E163|A slender guy that had been sitting on the chair in front of the~lectern stood up after noticing us.

15524|0x0017E3D4|Yeah, I was just thinking, like, you might've gotten bored out of your~mind.
15525|0x0017E42B|Yeah, I was just thinking,~like, you might've gotten bored~out of your mind.
15526|0x0017E4A3|No worries. Kosame-kun and I had a relaxing time together drinking~tea.
15527|0x0017E4F5|No worries. Kosame-kun and I~had a relaxing time together~drinking tea.
15528|0x0017E57F|So relaxing that I could've fallen asleep.
15529|0x0017E5B4|So relaxing that I could've~fallen asleep.
15530|0x0017E60A|Yeah, we already finished watching all the movies we checked out from~the library, after all. I need to go borrow some new ones.

15552|0x0017F048|I went with a polite self-introduction.

15554|0x0017F0CB|And this is our club president, the one and only Okaizumi Haruto.
15555|0x0017F117|And this is our club president,~the one and only Okaizumi~Haruto.
15556|0x0017F168|Okaizumi-senpai had a questioning look on his face.
15557|0x0017F1A6|Okaizumi-senpai had a~questioning look on his face.
15558|0x0017F1F5|And what brings a transfer student to our Astro Club?
15559|0x0017F235|And what brings a transfer~student to our Astro Club?
15560|0x0017F27A|At that point, something suddenly occurred to Okaizumi-senpai.

15564|0x0017F440|No, he's a transfer student. You just called him one yourself.
15565|0x0017F489|No, he's a transfer student.~You just called him one~yourself.
15566|0x0017F4F1|He could easily be a spy guising himself as a transfer student for all~we know...

15777|0x00184B36|With what exactly?
15778|0x00184B72|With us, the Astro Club, using the lookout. That place has a lot of~special memories from your past, right?
15779|0x00184BE8|With us, the Astro Club, using~the lookout. That place has a~lot of special memories from~your past, right?
15780|0x00184C63|So that's what she was worried about.
15781|0x00184C93|So that's what she was worried~about.
15782|0x00184CD2|Well yeah, it does, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to be mad if~anyone else steps foot in it.
15783|0x00184D40|Well yeah, it does, but that~doesn't mean that I'm going to~be mad if anyone else steps~foot in it.
15784|0x00184DB3|Mare, for example, also visited there quite frequently.
15785|0x00184DF5|Mare, for example, also visited~there quite frequently.
15786|0x00184E3C|In fact, I'd rather have more people visiting it, so that I could ask~them whether they'd seen the girl from the lookout.
15787|0x00184EC0|In fact, I'd rather have more~people visiting it, so that I~could ask them whether they'd~seen the girl from the lookout.
15788|0x00184F49|...I suppose it was also because the lookout became off-limits that I~never saw the girl from the lookout there.
15789|0x00184FC4|...I suppose it was also~because the lookout became~off-limits that I never saw the~girl from the lookout there.
15790|0x00185064|Hmm, I wonder...
15791|0x0018507F|Hmm, I wonder...
15792|0x001850A9|What's bothering you?
15793|0x001850C9|What's bothering you?
15794|0x00185108|N-No, it's nothing.

15804|0x001854B8|We can finally put our time as the Card Club behind us. Hooray!
15805|0x00185502|We can finally put our time as~the Card Club behind us.~Hooray!

15807|0x001855DF|No we can't. I'm sure you know~as well as I do that the~lookout is off-limits.
15808|0x00185657|Nobody will see us if we just go late at night.
15809|0x00185691|Nobody will see us if we just~go late at night.
15810|0x001856EA|It's precisely because we'd go there at night that makes it dangerous.~The path there is pretty much just a back road with no safety railing~or anything. If you happen to miss your footing, you'll end up~tumbling down all the way to the town.

16911|0x0019C490|Kosame-san saw right through~me.
16912|0x0019C4F5|What did you promise me and Asuka-kun, You-chan? I don't remember~anything.

16914|0x0019C5B0|Well, if you don't remember it, that's okay too.
16915|0x0019C5EB|Well, if you don't remember it,~that's okay too.
16916|0x0019C65E|The only thing that comes to mind is when you told me you'd introduce~your sister to the Occult Club.

16930|0x0019CC25|Your demeanor during that initial report led me to deduce the end~result.
16931|0x0019CC79|Your demeanor during that~initial report led me to deduce~the end result.
16932|0x0019CD07|Kogasaka, I knew I could trust in you!
16933|0x0019CD38|Kogasaka, I knew I could trust~in you!
16934|0x0019CD88|H-Huh? What's going on?
16935|0x0019CDAA|H-Huh? What's going on?
16936|0x0019CDFF|Asuho, I have something I need to say. Just keep calm and hear me out~on this.
16937|0x0019CE58|Asuho, I have something I need~to say. Just keep calm and hear~me out on this.
16938|0x0019CEB6|As a gentleman, I had to tell her.
16939|0x0019CEE3|As a gentleman, I had to tell~her.
16940|0x0019CF44|...Okay.
16941|0x0019CF57|...Okay.
16942|0x0019CF6F|For some reason, Asuho blushed.
16943|0x0019CF99|For some reason, Asuho blushed.
16944|0x0019CFD2|You see, my sister isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.
16945|0x0019D014|You see, my sister isn't the~sharpest tool in the shed.
16946|0x0019D075|...You shouldn't say mean things about your own sister, You-chan.
16947|0x0019D0C1|...You shouldn't say mean~things about your own sister,~You-chan.
16948|0x0019D11C|I invited her to the Astro Club, but she said there was another group~she wanted to join, no matter what.
16949|0x0019D190|I invited her to the Astro~Club, but she said there was~another group she wanted to~join, no matter what.
16950|0x0019D240|And if I had to guess, that must have been the Occult Club.
16951|0x0019D286|And if I had to guess, that~must have been the Occult Club.
16952|0x0019D2EB|Huh? Wh-Why?
16953|0x0019D302|Huh? Wh-Why?
16954|0x0019D328|She wants to ride in a UFO, she said.
16955|0x0019D358|She wants to ride in a UFO, she~said.
16956|0x0019D3A7|Well, I wouldn't mind doing that either.
16957|0x0019D3DA|Well, I wouldn't mind doing~that either.
16958|0x0019D412|(Even Asuho wants to ride one...?)
16959|0x0019D43F|(Even Asuho wants to ride~one...?)
16960|0x0019D47B|But the crucial point here is, it seems like Chinami's actually not~saying that as a joke. She seriously plans on riding one.

16962|0x0019D5C1|I see some promise in that gal already.
16963|0x0019D5F3|I see some promise in that gal~already.
16964|0x0019D62A|It sounded like evidence of the exact opposite to me.
16965|0x0019D66A|It sounded like evidence of the~exact opposite to me.
16966|0x0019D6B9|Which means Asuka has won this battle.
16967|0x0019D6EA|Which means Asuka has won this~battle.
16968|0x0019D73A|R-Really?
16969|0x0019D74E|R-Really?
16970|0x0019D781|So yeah, hate to break it to ya, Minahoshi, but I'm gonna be taking~Kogasaka's little sister.

16974|0x0019D8B3|Her shoulders drooped with disappointment.
16975|0x0019D8E8|Her shoulders drooped with~disappointment.
16976|0x0019D961|It is most unfortunate, but we have to respect her right to make her~own decision in the matter.

16980|0x0019DA8B|Are you not allowed to be in more than one club?
16981|0x0019DAC6|Are you not allowed to be in~more than one club?
16982|0x0019DB20|If we were, I wouldn't be fighting over members with Asuka-kun...

16984|0x0019DBBD|Touche.
16985|0x0019DBCF|Touche.
16986|0x0019DBF0|There's still a continuation to my report, Asuho. Don't get too~depressed just yet.
16987|0x0019DC4E|There's still a continuation to~my report, Asuho. Don't get too~depressed just yet.
16988|0x0019DCB1|I hurriedly added that in for Asuho's sake.
16989|0x0019DCE7|I hurriedly added that in for~Asuho's sake.
16990|0x0019DD32|There's a girl that's even more likely to join us than Chinami. She~lives next-door to us and isn't in any club yet.
16991|0x0019DDB1|There's a girl that's even more~likely to join us than Chinami.~She lives next-door to us and~isn't in any club yet.

16993|0x0019DEBF|Huh, say what? Who is she? Her~name? Her grade?
16994|0x0019DF08|...You really don't have to get right in my face.
16995|0x0019DF44|...You really don't have to get~right in my face.
16996|0x0019DF85|I assume it's just a bad habit of hers to invade people's space, but I~don't think I'll ever get used to it.
16997|0x0019DFFC|I assume it's just a bad habit~of hers to invade people's~space, but I don't think I'll~ever get used to it.
16998|0x0019E082|Her name's Aoi Isuzu, a first year girl. There's a chance she may be~interested in stargazing.

17000|0x0019E188|Wow, for real?
17001|0x0019E1A1|Wow, for real?
17002|0x0019E1F6|Does she love the stars?
17003|0x0019E219|Does she love the stars?
17004|0x0019E24B|Probably. She does star divination and stuff.
17005|0x0019E283|Probably. She does star~divination and stuff.
17006|0x0019E2DA|That sure sounds promising!
17007|0x0019E300|That sure sounds promising!
17008|0x0019E32B|Asuho's mood instantaneously recovered.
17009|0x0019E35D|Asuho's mood instantaneously~recovered.
17010|0x0019E3C8|But if she's still free, that means I have a chance with this one,~too.
17011|0x0019E41A|But if she's still free, that~means I have a chance with this~one, too.
17012|0x0019E471|(She did say she'd like to ride in a UFO...)
17013|0x0019E4A8|(She did say she'd like to ride~in a UFO...)
17014|0x0019E4EE|I'm introducing Chinami to you, so I'd say Asuho gets dibs when it~comes to Aoi-san.
17015|0x0019E54D|I'm introducing Chinami to you,~so I'd say Asuho gets dibs when~it comes to Aoi-san.
17016|0x0019E603|You're the best, You-chan!
17017|0x0019E628|You're the best, You-chan!
17018|0x0019E65C|She's in the same class as Chinami, so do you wanna come with me to~invite her after school?
17019|0x0019E6C3|She's in the same class as~Chinami, so do you wanna come~with me to invite her after~school?
17020|0x0019E749|Yeah!
17021|0x0019E759|Yeah!
17022|0x0019E76E|Asuho had a big, cheerful smile stretching from ear to ear.
17023|0x0019E7B4|Asuho had a big, cheerful smile~stretching from ear to ear.
17024|0x0019E7FF|I think the same was true back in grade school, too. That kind of~smile really suits her.
17025|0x0019E863|I think the same was true back~in grade school, too. That kind~of smile really suits her.
17026|0x0019E8CC|That smile is even brighter than the stars in the night sky. It's more~reminiscent of the sun shining way up in the blue sky.

17028|0x0019EA1D|When school let out, the four of us quickly put our stuff into our~bags and left the classroom.

17030|0x0019EB50|You said it was 1-C, right?
17031|0x0019EB76|You said it was 1-C, right?
17032|0x0019EBAB|Yep. If we hurry there, we should be able to catch Aoi-san before she~leaves to go home.
17033|0x0019EC0E|Yep. If we hurry there, we~should be able to catch Aoi-san~before she leaves to go home.
17034|0x0019ECAD|As much as I would really love to accompany you, I have Library~Committee work today...
17035|0x0019ED0F|As much as I would really love~to accompany you, I have~Library Committee work today...
17036|0x0019ED90|Bummer. Guess that means we'll have to say goodbye on the second~floor.
17037|0x0019EDE2|Bummer. Guess that means we'll~have to say goodbye on the~second floor.
17038|0x0019EE39|The freshmen's classrooms are on the first floor, and the specialized~rooms are on the second floor.
17039|0x0019EEA8|The freshmen's classrooms are~on the first floor, and the~specialized rooms are on the~second floor.
17040|0x0019EF52|So Chinami-chan's waiting for us in her classroom, right?
17041|0x0019EF96|So Chinami-chan's waiting for~us in her classroom, right?
17042|0x0019EFDF|(He hasn't even met her yet and he's already calling her~Chinami-chan...)
17043|0x0019F033|(He hasn't even met her yet and~he's already calling her~Chinami-chan...)
17044|0x0019F0A6|After two years all by myself, I'm finally gonna snag another member!
17045|0x0019F0F6|After two years all by myself,~I'm finally gonna snag another~member!
17046|0x0019F165|Yeah, I almost wanna just give you her out of pity. You've been all~alone ever since you formed that club when you first started here.
17047|0x0019F1F6|Yeah, I almost wanna just give~you her out of pity. You've~been all alone ever since you~formed that club when you first
17048|0x0019F298|I suppose this is a good opportunity to tell you that class changes~are only done in the third year at this school, so the three of us~have been in the same class for as long as we've been here.
17049|0x0019F365|I suppose this is a good~opportunity to tell you that~class changes are only done in~the third year at this school,
17050|0x0019F402|The only thing that changed when we moved up grades were the uniforms.
17051|0x0019F453|The only thing that changed~when we moved up grades were~the uniforms.
17052|0x0019F4C3|The freshman uniform was the one that changed though, not ours.
17053|0x0019F50D|The freshman uniform was the~one that changed though, not~ours.
17054|0x0019F576|Yeah, they introduced those new girls' uniforms this year. I dunno if~they planned on using it to attract new students or what, though.
17055|0x0019F608|Yeah, they introduced those new~girls' uniforms this year. I~dunno if they planned on using~it to attract new students or
17056|0x0019F691|So that's why freshmen girls and the girls in the higher grade levels~have different uniforms.
17057|0x0019F6FA|So that's why freshmen girls~and the girls in the higher~grade levels have different~uniforms.
17058|0x0019F772|You didn't recruit any members last year, Asuka?
17059|0x0019F7AD|You didn't recruit any members~last year, Asuka?
17060|0x0019F807|Nope. At first, I figured it'd be just fine with me on my own. I mean,~that makes things easier, y'know.
17061|0x0019F87A|Nope. At first, I figured it'd~be just fine with me on my own.~I mean, that makes things~easier, y'know.
17062|0x0019F8FC|Well, I guess that's more convenient if you're always running from~place to place with a camera in your hand.
17063|0x0019F974|Well, I guess that's more~convenient if you're always~running from place to place~with a camera in your hand.
17064|0x0019FA0B|But partway through the year, I noticed that there wasn't really any~need to make a club out of it if I just do all the stuff on my own.
17065|0x0019FA9E|But partway through the year, I~noticed that there wasn't~really any need to make a club~out of it if I just do all the
17066|0x0019FB2F|Yeah, uh, that's something you should've noticed before you made the~club.
17067|0x0019FB84|Yeah, uh, that's something you~should've noticed before you~made the club.
17068|0x0019FBF8|So that's why I've been keeping my eyes peeled for new recruits this~year, but I couldn't get a hold of any for the same reason as you guys~in the Astro Club.
17069|0x0019FCA1|So that's why I've been keeping~my eyes peeled for new recruits~this year, but I couldn't get a~hold of any for the same reason
17070|0x0019FD3A|None of the incoming first-years wanted to join?
17071|0x0019FD75|None of the incoming~first-years wanted to join?
17072|0x0019FDCF|At the end of the day, everyone prefers to join official clubs. After~all, those have more members, which makes it easier to make new~friends, too.
17073|0x0019FE6D|At the end of the day, everyone~prefers to join official clubs.~After all, those have more~members, which makes it easier
17074|0x0019FEF6|I can understand why someone would feel that way.
17075|0x0019FF32|I can understand why someone~would feel that way.
17076|0x0019FF7D|Kinda sounds like basically anyone can start up a fan club at any time~for just about anything.
17077|0x0019FFE7|Kinda sounds like basically~anyone can start up a fan club~at any time for just about~anything.
17078|0x001A0070|If you want to start up a club, you need to have the minimum required~number of members, but if it's just a small gathering of people then~you only need to apply for approval, which isn't a big hurdle to clear~as long as there are no obvious issues with

17083|0x001A02A8|Though in turn, those~unofficial clubs don't get a~club room or any funds to work~with.
17084|0x001A0319|But doesn't that make it sorta pointless to go out of your way to make~one?
17085|0x001A036F|But doesn't that make it sorta~pointless to go out of your way~to make one?
17086|0x001A03E4|In essence, I suppose you could say so. However, you must remember~that this is Hibarigasaki.

17088|0x001A04D3|It's just because there's not much to do around here for fun, so that~makes clubs kinda like a group hang out spot.

17090|0x001A05EE|I can't speak for other schools, but at Hibari High most people do~club activities after school.
17091|0x001A0659|I can't speak for other~schools, but at Hibari High~most people do club activities~after school.
17092|0x001A06C9|They had a point. Without clubs, there wouldn't be any good way for~students in different classes and years to meet.

17094|0x001A07E0|But official clubs are way better when it comes down to it. If you~receive club funds, you can do a lot more cool stuff together.

17100|0x001A0A9D|Yep. Some day, I would really like to eventually get club funds and~buy astronomy binoculars for each individual member.

17352|0x001A5F5B|Yeah, I ended up being a little bit late.
17353|0x001A5F8F|Yeah, I ended up being a little~bit late.
17354|0x001A5FD2|Why would you wait for me?
17355|0x001A5FF7|Why would you wait for me?
17356|0x001A6021|Asuho had to stop and think about how to answer that question for a~brief moment.
17357|0x001A607D|Asuho had to stop and think~about how to answer that~question for a brief moment.
17358|0x001A60F8|There's something that's been on my mind.
17359|0x001A612C|There's something that's been~on my mind.
17360|0x001A616F|What's that?
17361|0x001A6186|What's that?
17362|0x001A61BC|The girl from the lookout.
17363|0x001A61E1|The girl from the lookout.
17364|0x001A6215|......
17365|0x001A6226|......
17366|0x001A6256|You went to the lookout, right?
17367|0x001A6280|You went to the lookout, right?
17368|0x001A62AF|I nodded yes.
17369|0x001A62C7|I nodded yes.
17370|0x001A62FE|Were you able to see her?
17371|0x001A6322|Were you able to see her?
17372|0x001A6355|No.
17373|0x001A6363|No.
17374|0x001A6376|In the end, I wasn't able to see either her or Mare.
17375|0x001A63B5|In the end, I wasn't able to~see either her or Mare.
17376|0x001A6413|That's a shame. Well, I hope you'll be able to see her next time.
17377|0x001A645F|That's a shame. Well, I hope~you'll be able to see her next~time.
17378|0x001A64BA|Asuho, you're misunderstanding something fundamental here.
17379|0x001A64FF|Asuho, you're misunderstanding~something fundamental here.
17380|0x001A6563|...Huh?
17381|0x001A6575|...Huh?
17382|0x001A6596|I mean, you were with me when we investigated it, right? She isn't in~this town anymore.
17383|0x001A65F9|I mean, you were with me when~we investigated it, right? She~isn't in this town anymore.
17384|0x001A6661|I said that not only to her, but also to remind myself of the fact.
17385|0x001A66AF|I said that not only to her,~but also to remind myself of~the fact.
17386|0x001A670C|So it's not like I'm going to the lookout because I think I might see~her there by some chance.
17387|0x001A6776|So it's not like I'm going to~the lookout because I think I~might see her there by some~chance.
17388|0x001A67E5|Asuho directed her gaze down to her feet.
17389|0x001A6819|Asuho directed her gaze down to~her feet.
17390|0x001A686C|...Liar.
17391|0x001A687F|...Liar.
17392|0x001A68A1|It's the truth.
17393|0x001A68BB|It's the truth.
17394|0x001A68F4|Then why do you keep going there?
17395|0x001A6920|Then why do you keep going~there?
17396|0x001A6951|The answer that immediately came to mind was because I wanted to see~Mare.
17397|0x001A69A6|The answer that immediately~came to mind was because I~wanted to see Mare.
17398|0x001A6A00|However, that wasn't something I could say here.
17399|0x001A6A3B|However, that wasn't something~I could say here.
17400|0x001A6A7B|It's not like I was keeping it a secret from the others. For instance,~I nonchalantly told Chinami all about it.
17401|0x001A6AF6|It's not like I was keeping it~a secret from the others. For~instance, I nonchalantly told~Chinami all about it.
17402|0x001A6B76|Maybe I just hesitated to say it because of the weird atmosphere that~still existed between me and Asuho.
17403|0x001A6BEA|Maybe I just hesitated to say~it because of the weird~atmosphere that still existed~between me and Asuho.
17404|0x001A6C7D|You know, I actually considered going back to chase after you.
17405|0x001A6CC6|You know, I actually considered~going back to chase after you.
17406|0x001A6D14|Asuho placed her hands behind herself and rested them on the cardboard~box she was sitting on before lifting up her chin and gazing at the~ceiling.

17408|0x001A6E54|But the sky was slightly clouded, so I figured there wasn't any chance~of seeing the stars out.
17409|0x001A6EBE|But the sky was slightly~clouded, so I figured there~wasn't any chance of seeing the~stars out.
17410|0x001A6F47|That's why I eventually chose not to go after you.
17411|0x001A6F84|That's why I eventually chose~not to go after you.
17412|0x001A6FC6|I couldn't really understand her reasoning.
17413|0x001A6FFC|I couldn't really understand~her reasoning.
17414|0x001A7051|I'd like to hear you talk, You-chan.

17418|0x001A7121|...Didn't I just tell you? I'm not as knowledgeable as you about those~myths.
17419|0x001A7179|...Didn't I just tell you? I'm~not as knowledgeable as you~about those myths.
17420|0x001A71F0|There's plenty of stuff I'm not knowledgeable about, isn't there?

17422|0x001A728D|(What is she talking about?)
17423|0x001A72B4|(What is she talking about?)
17424|0x001A72FA|Talking about stars is all fine in itself, but right now, I'd rather~just hear you talk about yourself.
17425|0x001A736C|Talking about stars is all fine~in itself, but right now, I'd~rather just hear you talk about~yourself.
17426|0x001A73FD|I kinda wanna hear the stories about what happened to you after you~transferred.

17430|0x001A74E9|I don't really think that could be classified as doing Astro Club~activities.
17431|0x001A7541|I don't really think that could~be classified as doing Astro~Club activities.
17432|0x001A75B8|If you do, I wouldn't mind telling you about my middle school days,~too, in return.
17433|0x001A7616|If you do, I wouldn't mind~telling you about my middle~school days, too, in return.

17445|0x001A78A8|Don't tell her.
17446|0x001A78F4|...All right. But I don't want to hear any complaints if it's too~boring.
17447|0x001A7948|...All right. But I don't want~to hear any complaints if it's~too boring.
17448|0x001A79BB|Sure. No complaints from me.

17450|0x001A7A0E|Asuho nodded with a bright smile on her face.
17451|0x001A7A46|Asuho nodded with a bright~smile on her face.
17452|0x001A7AA2|I gave her a condensed rundown on what happened to me after I moved.
17453|0x001A7AF1|I gave her a condensed rundown~on what happened to me after I~moved.
17454|0x001A7B45|I told her about the fact that even though it was a school in an urban~city, I felt like the only notable difference to the school in~Hibarigasaki was that the school grounds were smaller.
17455|0x001A7C0C|I told her about the fact that~even though it was a school in~an urban city, I felt like the~only notable difference to the
17456|0x001A7C97|About how, at first, I experienced some difficulties making friends,~but managed to make some really great friends by the time graduation~rolled around.
17457|0x001A7D3A|About how, at first, I~experienced some difficulties~making friends, but managed to~make some really great friends
17458|0x001A7DBC|Then I told her how I made new friends again when I got into middle~school, and that, while I didn't join any club or committee, whenever~it came down to school events, I buckled down together with all my~classmates.
17459|0x001A7E9F|Then I told her how I made new~friends again when I got into~middle school, and that, while~I didn't join any club or
17460|0x001A7F24|And how we guys sometimes got scolded by the girls for fooling around,~but how much fun it was in its own right.
17461|0x001A7F9F|And how we guys sometimes got~scolded by the girls for~fooling around, but how much~fun it was in its own right.
17462|0x001A801F|End of story.
17463|0x001A8037|End of story.
17464|0x001A8054|I was only talking about myself, so I'm sure most people would have~gotten bored listening to my story.
17465|0x001A80C6|I was only talking about~myself, so I'm sure most people~would have gotten bored~listening to my story.
17466|0x001A813D|I'm incredibly normal. My school life wasn't exceptionally different~from anyone else's.
17467|0x001A81A0|I'm incredibly normal. My~school life wasn't~exceptionally different from~anyone else's.
17468|0x001A8208|Although I did miss out on a lot of things during elementary school.
17469|0x001A8257|Although I did miss out on a~lot of things during elementary~school.
17470|0x001A82AB|Incidentally, I didn't tell Asuho anything about the tsundere class~rep or the girl with glasses from the Library Committee.
17471|0x001A8332|Incidentally, I didn't tell~Asuho anything about the~tsundere class rep or the girl~with glasses from the Library
17472|0x001A8408|It's almost hard to believe that you're the same You-chan I knew from~elementary.
17473|0x001A8464|It's almost hard to believe~that you're the same You-chan I~knew from elementary.
17474|0x001A84CF|I guess so.
17475|0x001A84E5|I guess so.
17476|0x001A851A|You moved away because of your parents' work, right? That's what our~teacher told us back then.
17477|0x001A8584|You moved away because of your~parents' work, right? That's~what our teacher told us back~then.

17480|0x001A8654|So then...
17481|0x001A8669|So then...
17482|0x001A8683|This seemed like the topic that Asuho really wanted to know about.
17483|0x001A86D0|This seemed like the topic that~Asuho really wanted to know~about.
17484|0x001A873C|You-chan, why did you come back to Hibarigasaki?
17485|0x001A8777|You-chan, why did you come back~to Hibarigasaki?
17486|0x001A87B7|She asked me, almost like there was a specific answer that she~expected.
17487|0x001A880A|She asked me, almost like there~was a specific answer that she~expected.
17488|0x001A886C|All right, your turn now.
17489|0x001A8890|All right, your turn now.
17490|0x001A88D3|...You're ignoring my question.
17491|0x001A88FD|...You're ignoring my question.
17492|0x001A892C|What I would've had to tell her was something even less enjoyable for~others to hear about than the story of my school days.

17518|0x001A8E84|Her reply seemed kind of snarky.

17520|0x001A8EF9|You-chan, are you gonna go back to the lookout today?
17521|0x001A8F39|You-chan, are you gonna go back~to the lookout today?

17524|0x001A901A|...Ahaha.
17525|0x001A902E|...Ahaha.
17526|0x001A9047|Out of nowhere, Asuho started laughing.
17527|0x001A9079|Out of nowhere, Asuho started~laughing.
17528|0x001A90CA|Sorry, forget I said that.
17529|0x001A90EF|Sorry, forget I said that.
17530|0x001A9119|I don't know if it was written on my face that I didn't want to talk~about it, but Asuho voluntarily backed away from that subject.

17548|0x001A95D7|Huh?!
17549|0x001A95E7|Huh?!
17550|0x001A9606|We could do some stargazing there like last time. It might create some~problems if the entire club comes, but it should be fine if it's just~you and me on our own time. So, what do you say?
17551|0x001A96CE|We could do some stargazing~there like last time. It might~create some problems if the~entire club comes, but it

17566|0x001A9AE7|I have to help out at the cafe on most weekday nights, so I can't go~outside!
17567|0x001A9B3F|I have to help out at the cafe~on most weekday nights, so I~can't go outside!
17568|0x001A9B9C|Is that what upset her?
17569|0x001A9BBE|Is that what upset her?
17570|0x001A9BFF|I'd have it a lot easier if a certain someone would just hurry up and~start working at our cafe!
17571|0x001A9C6A|I'd have it a lot easier if a~certain someone would just~hurry up and start working at~our cafe!
17572|0x001A9CDA|I mustered up a weak smile.

17576|0x001A9E34|Wow! You mean it?
17577|0x001A9E50|Wow! You mean it?

17579|0x001A9EF4|Yeah. I'm still planning on~looking around at other places,~but I'll consider your cafe~along with the others.
17580|0x001A9F8C|Thank you sooo much, You-chan! Dad's been at his wits' end lately~'cause we haven't gotten any applicants even with the poster he put~up.

17583|0x001AA12D|I'd guess it's hard to find~part-timers because almost all~Hibari High students are~preoccupied with their clubs.
17584|0x001AA1C8|And there's also that getting a part-time job isn't allowed by~default. You did get permission, you said?
17585|0x001AA23C|And there's also that getting a~part-time job isn't allowed by~default. You did get~permission, you said?
17586|0x001AA2BF|Yeah. Pretty much straight away due to family reasons on my end.
17587|0x001AA30A|Yeah. Pretty much straight away~due to family reasons on my~end.
17588|0x001AA374|What family reasons?
17589|0x001AA393|What family reasons?
17590|0x001AA3C1|Chinami and I are staying at a relative's house, and food expenses~skyrocket when you suddenly have two more mouth's to feed.
17591|0x001AA449|Chinami and I are staying at a~relative's house, and food~expenses skyrocket when you~suddenly have two more mouth's
17592|0x001AA4E7|Oh... so that's why you're so desperate to find a job.
17593|0x001AA528|Oh... so that's why you're so~desperate to find a job.
17594|0x001AA578|Pretty much.
17595|0x001AA58F|Pretty much.
17596|0x001AA5C5|Was it actually a problem that I invited you into the Astro Club?
17597|0x001AA611|Was it actually a problem that~I invited you into the Astro~Club?
17598|0x001AA66C|Nah, not at all. We're not that hard up.
17599|0x001AA69F|Nah, not at all. We're not that~hard up.
17600|0x001AA6D7|Honestly, I've never heard Shino-san talk about having money problems.~Quite the contrary, she's actually opposed to either of us getting a~part-time job.
17601|0x001AA77C|Honestly, I've never heard~Shino-san talk about having~money problems. Quite the~contrary, she's actually
17602|0x001AA7FF|Then how about we do our astronomical observations some time this~weekend?
17603|0x001AA854|Then how about we do our~astronomical observations some~time this weekend?
17604|0x001AA8C8|Sure!
17605|0x001AA8D8|Sure!
17606|0x001AA8ED|There was no hesitation in Asuho's response.
17607|0x001AA924|There was no hesitation in~Asuho's response.
17608|0x001AA97A|Though we might want to just call it stargazing instead of~astronomical observations, since we're not doing this as a club~activity.
17609|0x001AAA09|Though we might want to just~call it stargazing instead of~astronomical observations,~since we're not doing this as a
17610|0x001AAA98|You're quite fussy about such a small detail.
17611|0x001AAAD0|You're quite fussy about such a~small detail.
17612|0x001AAB0D|I doubt it really matters either way what we call it.
17613|0x001AAB4D|I doubt it really matters~either way what we call it.
17614|0x001AABAC|That's because I think your first real observation experience should~be an official Astro Club activity...
17615|0x001AAC21|That's because I think your~first real observation~experience should be an~official Astro Club activity...
17616|0x001AACB5|So instead I'll take your first 'stargazing' experience.
17617|0x001AACF8|So instead I'll take your first~'stargazing' experience.
17618|0x001AAD40|Is there any real meaning behind nitpicking like that?
17619|0x001AAD81|Is there any real meaning~behind nitpicking like that?
17620|0x001AADE1|Maybe I should have you carry the telescope to the lookout? You know,~making the best of the opportunity and all.
17621|0x001AAE5D|Maybe I should have you carry~the telescope to the lookout?~You know, making the best of~the opportunity and all.
17622|0x001AAEE8|Sure, but in exchange I'll have you tell me about all the knacks of~astronomical observation... Sorry, I mean stargazing. You know, since~it'll be my first time.
17623|0x001AAF94|Sure, but in exchange I'll have~you tell me about all the~knacks of astronomical~observation... Sorry, I mean
17624|0x001AB02B|Sure, I can do that. I'll tell you later what you need to bring.
17625|0x001AB076|Sure, I can do that. I'll tell~you later what you need to~bring.
17626|0x001AB0F1|I heard the clatter of a door opening and closing.
17627|0x001AB12E|I heard the clatter of a door~opening and closing.
17628|0x001AB17A|Seems like we've got company.
17629|0x001AB1A2|Seems like we've got company.
17630|0x001AB203|Okaizumi-senpai, probably. Though he's actually pretty late today.
17631|0x001AB250|Okaizumi-senpai, probably.~Though he's actually pretty~late today.
17632|0x001AB2A2|Asuho stood up, and, with that, our conversation came to an end for~the moment.
17633|0x001AB2FC|Asuho stood up, and, with that,~our conversation came to an end~for the moment.
17634|0x001AB3C2|Oh, so that's where you guys were. I didn't spot anyone in the club~room, so I figured it was just me today.
17635|0x001AB439|Oh, so that's where you guys~were. I didn't spot anyone in~the club room, so I figured it~was just me today.
17636|0x001AB4B5|The moment Okaizumi saw us, visible relief spread across his face.
17637|0x001AB502|The moment Okaizumi saw us,~visible relief spread across~his face.
17638|0x001AB574|I was already sure you'd gotten sick of the club and quit, leaving me~all alone...
17639|0x001AB5D1|I was already sure you'd gotten~sick of the club and quit,~leaving me all alone...
17640|0x001AB633|His expression of relief didn't last long, as a new wave of depression~immediately washed over him.
17641|0x001AB6A1|His expression of relief didn't~last long, as a new wave of~depression immediately washed~over him.
17642|0x001AB747|We'd never do that. On the contrary, we're hot on the hunt for some~new members!
17643|0x001AB7A2|We'd never do that. On the~contrary, we're hot on the hunt~for some new members!
17644|0x001AB81C|Well, that's great and all... but since it was just yesterday when~Kogasaka-kun joined, statistically speaking I can't see us finding~another member before the next semester...
17645|0x001AB8D7|Well, that's great and all...~but since it was just yesterday~when Kogasaka-kun joined,~statistically speaking I can't
17646|0x001AB977|Ughh! Have a little bit more confidence, would you!
17647|0x001AB9B5|Ughh! Have a little bit more~confidence, would you!
17648|0x001ABA02|Senpai, do you happen to know anyone who might potentially join the~Astro Club?
17649|0x001ABA5C|Senpai, do you happen to know~anyone who might potentially~join the Astro Club?
17650|0x001ABAD5|If there was, then I would have already invited them.
17651|0x001ABB15|If there was, then I would have~already invited them.
17652|0x001ABB5A|...The absolute conviction of that was rather disturbing.
17653|0x001ABB9E|...The absolute conviction of~that was rather disturbing.
17654|0x001ABC01|Do you, Kogasaka-kun?
17655|0x001ABC21|Do you, Kogasaka-kun?
17656|0x001ABC50|Just one, but yeah.
17657|0x001ABC6E|Just one, but yeah.
17658|0x001ABCAB|Thanks for trying to cheer me up! You're the greatest friend a guy~could ever ask for!
17659|0x001ABD0C|Thanks for trying to cheer me~up! You're the greatest friend~a guy could ever ask for!
17660|0x001ABD7C|...Uh, no, I'm serious.
17661|0x001ABD9E|...Uh, no, I'm serious.
17662|0x001ABDDF|So he's in depression mode today, huh? When he's in this mode, it~doesn't matter what you say, he'll always interpret it in a negative~way.
17663|0x001ABE75|So he's in depression mode~today, huh? When he's in this~mode, it doesn't matter what~you say, he'll always interpret
17664|0x001ABEFA|This guy sure seems to have a rough life. He has some serious mood~swings, and sometimes he turns into a crazy person...
17665|0x001ABF7D|This guy sure seems to have a~rough life. He has some serious~mood swings, and sometimes he~turns into a crazy person...
17666|0x001AC01F|That's odd. I don't see Kosame-kun anywhere.
17667|0x001AC056|That's odd. I don't see~Kosame-kun anywhere.
17668|0x001AC0AC|She has stuff to do with the Library Committee, so she won't be here~today. You were pretty late yourself actually. Did you have some~committee work or something like that?
17669|0x001AC163|She has stuff to do with the~Library Committee, so she won't~be here today. You were pretty~late yourself actually. Did you
17670|0x001AC208|Come on. You know someone like me couldn't handle committee work, even~in my dreams.
17671|0x001AC267|Come on. You know someone like~me couldn't handle committee~work, even in my dreams.
17672|0x001AC2E5|...Well, uh, I might remind you that you're the representative of the~third-year class.
17673|0x001AC347|...Well, uh, I might remind you~that you're the representative~of the third-year class.
17674|0x001AC3AE|Dealing with this guy can be a real chore.
17675|0x001AC3E3|Dealing with this guy can be a~real chore.
17676|0x001AC45C|I was late because I went to go get this from one of the teachers. He~used to be the Astronomy Club's adviser when it was still a club,~actually.
17677|0x001AC4F8|I was late because I went to go~get this from one of the~teachers. He used to be the~Astronomy Club's adviser when
17678|0x001AC57A|Okaizumi-senpai picked up the thing which he had placed on a nearby~desk.
17679|0x001AC5CE|Okaizumi-senpai picked up the~thing which he had placed on a~nearby desk.
17680|0x001AC644|At first glance, it looked like a decorative telescope.
17681|0x001AC686|At first glance, it looked like~a decorative telescope.
17682|0x001AC6D9|...What's that?
17683|0x001AC6F3|...What's that?
17684|0x001AC724|A music box.
17685|0x001AC73B|A music box.
17686|0x001AC757|Okaizumi-senpai brushed over the cylindrical part of it with his~fingers.
17687|0x001AC7AB|Okaizumi-senpai brushed over~the cylindrical part of it with~his fingers.
17688|0x001AC810|Apparently, they brought it to an expert for repair while they still~had the chance right before the club was downgraded, but the former~adviser forgot to pass it along after he received it back until now.
17689|0x001AC8E8|Apparently, they brought it to~an expert for repair while they~still had the chance right~before the club was downgraded,
17690|0x001AC97B|So that means it's technically property of the club?
17691|0x001AC9BA|So that means it's technically~property of the club?
17692|0x001ACA0A|Guess you could take it that way. I hear it used to be something like~the Astronomy Club's symbol back in the day.
17693|0x001ACA87|Guess you could take it that~way. I hear it used to be~something like the Astronomy~Club's symbol back in the day.
17694|0x001ACB15|Oh? That music box sure has an usual design though. It kind of looks~like a telescope.
17695|0x001ACB76|Oh? That music box sure has an~usual design though. It kind of~looks like a telescope.
17696|0x001ACBE8|Apparently they call them kaleidoscope music boxes.
17697|0x001ACC26|Apparently they call them~kaleidoscope music boxes.
17698|0x001ACC75|...Kaleidoscope?
17699|0x001ACC90|...Kaleidoscope?
17700|0x001ACCBA|You mean it goes together with a kaleidoscope?
17701|0x001ACCF3|You mean it goes together with~a kaleidoscope?
17702|0x001ACD3D|Right. If you wind it up and look through the lens, you'll see a~beautiful array of multicolored lights.
17703|0x001ACDB0|Right. If you wind it up and~look through the lens, you'll~see a beautiful array of~multicolored lights.
17704|0x001ACE34|It's made in a way that the disc with the beads on it rotates. It's~normal for kaleidoscopes to rotate manually, but this one here rotates~automatically.
17705|0x001ACED8|It's made in a way that the~disc with the beads on it~rotates. It's normal for~kaleidoscopes to rotate
17706|0x001ACF4E|Okaizumi-senpai wound up the key at the bottom.
17707|0x001ACF88|Okaizumi-senpai wound up the~key at the bottom.
17708|0x001ACFD3|So actually, perhaps calling it a telescope as Asuho-kun did isn't~necessarily wrong.
17709|0x001AD033|So actually, perhaps calling it~a telescope as Asuho-kun did~isn't necessarily wrong.
17710|0x001AD0A4|After all, if you look at the night sky through a telescope, you get a~multicolored starlight display not inferior to that of a kaleidoscope.
17711|0x001AD13C|After all, if you look at the~night sky through a telescope,~you get a multicolored~starlight display not inferior
17712|0x001AD218|...Isn't it, like, supposed to play music though?
17713|0x001AD254|...Isn't it, like, supposed to~play music though?
17714|0x001AD2C7|Huh?
17715|0x001AD2D6|Huh?
17716|0x001AD320|Okaizumi-senpai peeked at the bottom and once again wound up the key.
17717|0x001AD370|Okaizumi-senpai peeked at the~bottom and once again wound up~the key.
17718|0x001AD3C5|The key itself was spinning, but the crucial melody was missing.
17719|0x001AD410|The key itself was spinning,~but the crucial melody was~missing.
17720|0x001AD496|That sure is strange... I was told it should be all fixed up now.
17721|0x001AD4E2|That sure is strange... I was~told it should be all fixed up~now.
17722|0x001AD53D|It was broken before?
17723|0x001AD55D|It was broken before?
17724|0x001AD59C|So it seems. Apparently, it stayed broken for a fair while, so when~the Astronomy Club was about to be downgraded, I suppose someone must~have decided to take it to a craftsman for repair.
17725|0x001AD663|So it seems. Apparently, it~stayed broken for a fair while,~so when the Astronomy Club was~about to be downgraded, I
17726|0x001AD719|But it couldn't have been fixed if the tune's not playing, right?
17727|0x001AD765|But it couldn't have been fixed~if the tune's not playing,~right?
17728|0x001AD7D0|It really is peculiar, yeah... Well, guess I'll go ask the former~adviser.
17729|0x001AD825|It really is peculiar, yeah...~Well, guess I'll go ask the~former adviser.
17730|0x001AD88E|Music box in hand, Okaizumi-senpai left the room while tilting his~head in puzzlement.
17731|0x001AD8EF|Music box in hand,~Okaizumi-senpai left the room~while tilting his head in~puzzlement.
17732|0x001AD98C|...It's just the two of us again.
17733|0x001AD9B8|...It's just the two of us~again.
17734|0x001AD9F3|I've been wondering about something. That 'former adviser'~Okaizumi-senpai was talking about used to be the Astronomy Club's~adviser, right?
17735|0x001ADA8A|I've been wondering about~something. That 'former~adviser' Okaizumi-senpai was~talking about used to be the
17736|0x001ADB1F|Yeah, apparently. I don't know which teacher he is though.
17737|0x001ADB64|Yeah, apparently. I don't know~which teacher he is though.
17738|0x001ADBBA|From what Okaizumi-senpai tells me about him, he's a really weird guy~that has his face turned toward the blackboard at all times during~classes and never turns around to the students.
17739|0x001ADC7D|From what Okaizumi-senpai tells~me about him, he's a really~weird guy that has his face~turned toward the blackboard at
17740|0x001ADD04|...Can you actually teach classes like that?
17741|0x001ADD3B|...Can you actually teach~classes like that?
17742|0x001ADD81|So does the Astro Club not have an adviser?
17743|0x001ADDB7|So does the Astro Club not have~an adviser?
17744|0x001ADE0C|Clubs are one thing, but if even the unofficial clubs had their own~advisers, you'd just plain run out of teachers.
17745|0x001ADE8A|Clubs are one thing, but if~even the unofficial clubs had~their own advisers, you'd just~plain run out of teachers.
17746|0x001ADF0D|I guess that just speaks to the sheer number of clubs here at this~school.
17747|0x001ADF62|I guess that just speaks to the~sheer number of clubs here at~this school.
17748|0x001ADFD6|Besides, I think it's more common for academically oriented clubs to~not have an adviser in the first place. In my opinion, we don't need~one either.
17749|0x001AE076|Besides, I think it's more~common for academically~oriented clubs to not have an~adviser in the first place. In
17750|0x001AE0FF|True, we can all just ask you if there's something we don't know.
17751|0x001AE14B|True, we can all just ask you~if there's something we don't~know.
17752|0x001AE1B6|Okaizumi-senpai, too. He also knows a whole lot of astronomy.
17753|0x001AE1FE|Okaizumi-senpai, too. He also~knows a whole lot of astronomy.
17754|0x001AE255|So, what should we do now?
17755|0x001AE27A|So, what should we do now?
17756|0x001AE2BE|Hmm, good question. I mean, there's no telling when Okaizumi-senpai~will get back...
17757|0x001AE31D|Hmm, good question. I mean,~there's no telling when~Okaizumi-senpai will get~back...
17758|0x001AE38B|How about we go member hunting?
17759|0x001AE3B5|How about we go member hunting?
17760|0x001AE3FE|At this time of day, we would only run into other students doing their~own club activities. I'd say our prospects of success are way higher~in the morning.
17761|0x001AE4A4|At this time of day, we would~only run into other students~doing their own club~activities. I'd say our
17762|0x001AE525|...Kind of a tall order there.
17763|0x001AE54E|...Kind of a tall order there.
17764|0x001AE596|I bet, seeing as how you're just barely on time every morning.
17765|0x001AE5DF|I bet, seeing as how you're~just barely on time every~morning.
17766|0x001AE637|My job will be to win Aoi-san over, so I suppose I'll let you handle~any other potential club members.

17768|0x001AE738|Grr.

17772|0x001AE85E|There's still time until I have to start helping out at our cafe, so~how about we drop by the lookout?
17773|0x001AE8CF|There's still time until I have~to start helping out at our~cafe, so how about we drop by~the lookout?
17774|0x001AE94F|...Now?
17775|0x001AE961|...Now?
17776|0x001AE992|Yeah, right now.
17777|0x001AE9AD|Yeah, right now.
17778|0x001AE9D7|It kinda goes without saying, but we're not gonna be able to see any~stars at this time of day.
17779|0x001AEA41|It kinda goes without saying,~but we're not gonna be able to~see any stars at this time of~day.
17780|0x001AEACA|Grr.

17783|0x001AEB33|(...That's the second time~she's growled at me like a~dog.)
17784|0x001AEBAE|Just think of it as a detour while we take a stroll. Sound good?

17786|0x001AEC53|...Umm.
17787|0x001AEC65|...Umm.
17788|0x001AEC7C|I felt like I had no reason to turn her down.
17789|0x001AECB4|I felt like I had no reason to~turn her down.
17790|0x001AECF1|However, Mare wouldn't be there at this kind of time.
17791|0x001AED31|However, Mare wouldn't be there~at this kind of time.
17792|0x001AED76|That meant I would have to go back at night. That's why I hesitated to~agree right away.

17794|0x001AEE4B|Can we leave that for some other time? There's actually another place~I'd like to go.

17796|0x001AEF10|I wasn't making up an excuse either. I actually did have something~else to do.

17816|0x001AF57D|Grr.

17818|0x001AF5BA|Thank you very much for the detailed answer.

17824|0x001AF747|Well, you see, You-chan said he wanted to come to the library.
17825|0x001AF790|Well, you see, You-chan said he~wanted to come to the library.
17826|0x001AF7F8|Are you here to do some more research, Kogasaka-san?

17828|0x001AF885|Something like that, yeah.
17829|0x001AF8AA|Something like that, yeah.
17830|0x001AF8F4|Some more...? You-chan, are you really that interested in shinigami?
17831|0x001AF943|Some more...? You-chan, are you~really that interested in~shinigami?

17833|0x001AF9C9|...Shinigami?
17834|0x001AF9F0|Well, uh, that was just kinda like a figure of speech.
17835|0x001AFA31|Well, uh, that was just kinda~like a figure of speech.
17836|0x001AFA77|It would be much too difficult to go about explaining Mare to them.
17837|0x001AFAC5|It would be much too difficult~to go about explaining Mare to~them.
17838|0x001AFB38|I must say, there are quite a lot of first-years that are into those.

17840|0x001AFBDD|Kosame-san stated that all too nonchalantly.
17841|0x001AFC14|Kosame-san stated that all too~nonchalantly.
17842|0x001AFC6A|Well, just about any student who enrolls here will hear about that~urban legend at some point, after all. That rumor just won't~disappear.

17852|0x001B013E|Isn't that so precisely because he is a fan of the supernatural? I'd~assume quite unlike astronomy, in the world of the supernatural you~have new information coming and going on a fairly regular basis.

17854|0x001B02AC|So yeah, You-chan. I don't know where you heard about the shinigami~rumor, but I'm pretty sure you won't get anything out of investigating~it.
17855|0x001B0345|So yeah, You-chan. I don't know~where you heard about the~shinigami rumor, but I'm pretty~sure you won't get anything out

17870|0x001B06DD|I only know the shinigami as simply the shinigami, nothing else.
17871|0x001B0728|I only know the shinigami as~simply the shinigami, nothing~else.
17872|0x001B0792|Think someone tried spicing up the rumor or something?
17873|0x001B07D3|Think someone tried spicing up~the rumor or something?
17874|0x001B0833|Possibly. That's a rather common thing to see. It's quite the~interesting urban legend, so I would actually prefer it to continue~being passed on as is. Much like a tradition.

17883|0x001B0B1E|What's that Hibari High urban~legend anyway?
17884|0x001B0B74|It's a rumor about a shinigami. I think it says that when you cross~the shinigami's path, it tears you apart from the one you love most.

17894|0x001B0F54|It's mainly freshmen that have any interest in that urban legend. It's~fairly common for students to have completely forgotten about it by~the time they move up.

17910|0x001B14D9|That'd be a little hard. There's so many different versions of the~story floating around. I don't have a grasp on it all either.

17926|0x001B1A53|It's an urban legend of this school, so I'd guess at Hibari High,~right?

17928|0x001B1B18|Logically thinking, yes.

17930|0x001B1B6D|Did some rumor ever mention the shinigami appearing at the lookout?

17937|0x001B1E34|So there was ultimately no way~to judge whether that rumor was~about Mare or not.
17938|0x001B1EB1|Well, it's just some measly urban legend anyway. I'm obviously not~going to take it seriously.
17939|0x001B1F1A|Well, it's just some measly~urban legend anyway. I'm~obviously not going to take it~seriously.
17940|0x001B1F88|If that urban legend of the shinigami really is referring to Mare,~however, does that mean those who meet her are torn apart from the one~they love?
17941|0x001B2027|If that urban legend of the~shinigami really is referring~to Mare, however, does that~mean those who meet her are
17942|0x001B20A8|Since I've already met her several times, does that mean I've been~torn apart from someone I was in love with?
17943|0x001B2121|Since I've already met her~several times, does that mean~I've been torn apart from~someone I was in love with?
17944|0x001B219F|...I've forgotten the lookout girl's name due to Mare. Could you say~that is the result of tearing us apart?
17945|0x001B2216|...I've forgotten the lookout~girl's name due to Mare. Could~you say that is the result of~tearing us apart?
17946|0x001B22F6|You-chan's gone into thinking mode.

17948|0x001B2363|Did that also happen frequently back in elementary school?

17950|0x001B240C|I'd say that describes how he was the majority of time. Ahaha.
17951|0x001B2455|I'd say that describes how he~was the majority of time.~Ahaha.
17952|0x001B24B7|However, the reason that I couldn't meet the girl from the lookout~wasn't necessarily Mare's fault.
17953|0x001B2525|However, the reason that I~couldn't meet the girl from the~lookout wasn't necessarily~Mare's fault.
17954|0x001B2598|Even if I hadn't met Mare, my probability of seeing the girl from the~lookout again would've remained slim all the same.

17956|0x001B26A3|Since, if the girl from the lookout did leave Hibarigasaki like I~think she did, even remembering her name wouldn't put me in any better~of a position.

18258|0x001B8AF0|If you forgot her name, then yeah, I think I am the reason behind it.
18259|0x001B8B40|If you forgot her name, then~yeah, I think I am the reason~behind it.
18260|0x001B8B9F|So you stole my memories from me?
18261|0x001B8BCB|So you stole my memories from~me?
18262|0x001B8C06|Yes.
18263|0x001B8C15|Yes.
18264|0x001B8C33|Is that what you mean when you say that you reap nightmares?

18266|0x001B8CD0|Yes.
18267|0x001B8CDF|Yes.
18268|0x001B8CFD|Why are you able to do something like that?
18269|0x001B8D33|Why are you able to do~something like that?
18270|0x001B8D78|I do it because I can. That's the only answer I can give you.
18271|0x001B8DC0|I do it because I can. That's~the only answer I can give you.
18272|0x001B8E17|You mean you don't know how it works, but you know the result?
18273|0x001B8E60|You mean you don't know how it~works, but you know the result?
18274|0x001B8EB8|I guess.
18275|0x001B8ECB|I guess.
18276|0x001B8EE3|Let's put this into perspective.
18277|0x001B8F0E|Let's put this into~perspective.
18278|0x001B8F3E|It was undoubtedly my fault for forgetting her name, but I was eager~to shift responsibility onto my hallucination. That's one way to look~at it.
18279|0x001B8FDA|It was undoubtedly my fault for~forgetting her name, but I was~eager to shift responsibility~onto my hallucination. That's
18280|0x001B9064|In other words, my own weakness created Mare.
18281|0x001B909C|In other words, my own weakness~created Mare.
18282|0x001B90E3|Can you close your eyes for a moment?
18283|0x001B9113|Can you close your eyes for a~moment?
18284|0x001B917B|...Huh?
18285|0x001B918D|...Huh?
18286|0x001B91AE|Close your eyes, please.
18287|0x001B91D1|Close your eyes, please.
18288|0x001B9203|Why?
18289|0x001B9212|Why?
18290|0x001B9230|Just do it.
18291|0x001B9246|Just do it.
18292|0x001B9276|No.
18293|0x001B9284|No.
18294|0x001B9297|She outright refused.
18295|0x001B92B7|She outright refused.
18296|0x001B92E6|The other day, you told me to close my eyes, and then reaped me with~your scythe, right?
18297|0x001B9349|The other day, you told me to~close my eyes, and then reaped~me with your scythe, right?
18298|0x001B93BB|Yeah.
18299|0x001B93CB|Yeah.
18300|0x001B93EA|Then this is just give and take. This time, you close your eyes.

18302|0x001B949A|No.

18304|0x001B94BB|This little rascal, I swear.
18305|0x001B94E2|This little rascal, I swear.
18306|0x001B9518|Being ordered around happens to be one of the things in this world I~hate most. So, no.
18307|0x001B957A|Being ordered around happens to~be one of the things in this~world I hate most. So, no.
18308|0x001B95E1|If she really is a hallucination, then she's an awfully defiant one.
18309|0x001B9630|If she really is a~hallucination, then she's an~awfully defiant one.
18310|0x001B968E|Then what do I have to do for you to close your eyes?
18311|0x001B96CE|Then what do I have to do for~you to close your eyes?
18312|0x001B9728|Why do I have to close my eyes in the first place?
18313|0x001B9765|Why do I have to close my eyes~in the first place?
18314|0x001B97B1|Just to conduct a little experiment.
18315|0x001B97E0|Just to conduct a little~experiment.
18316|0x001B981E|And what's that?
18317|0x001B9839|And what's that?
18318|0x001B9863|You don't even know what an experiment is?
18319|0x001B9898|You don't even know what an~experiment is?
18320|0x001B98DC|Can I reap you?

18322|0x001B991F|Could you please put the scythe down?!
18323|0x001B9950|Could you please put the scythe~down?!
18324|0x001B9990|You're being a real blockhead today, you know that?
18325|0x001B99CE|You're being a real blockhead~today, you know that?
18326|0x001B9A1B|Why are you calling me a blockhead...?
18327|0x001B9A4C|Why are you calling me a~blockhead...?
18328|0x001B9A82|Is 'blockhead' better or worse than 'doofus'?

18330|0x001B9B01|Mare, you're a shinigami, right?
18331|0x001B9B2C|Mare, you're a shinigami,~right?
18332|0x001B9B71|If that's what you say I am, then I think that's probably correct.
18333|0x001B9BBE|If that's what you say I am,~then I think that's probably~correct.
18334|0x001B9C10|She gave quite the passive reply considering that she supposedly hates~being ordered around, but never mind that.
18335|0x001B9C8C|She gave quite the passive~reply considering that she~supposedly hates being ordered~around, but never mind that.
18336|0x001B9D17|You see, I don't believe that you could be a shinigami or anything~else besides a human.

18344|0x001B9F93|Yeah.
18345|0x001B9FA3|Yeah.
18346|0x001B9FB8|It seemed like she was pondering it, unable to make up her mind.
18347|0x001BA003|It seemed like she was~pondering it, unable to make up~her mind.
18348|0x001BA05D|Please. This isn't an order, I'm just asking you for a favor. I want~to treat you as a shinigami, if anything.

18350|0x001BA169|I don't have to be a shinigami if you don't want me to.
18351|0x001BA1AB|I don't have to be a shinigami~if you don't want me to.
18352|0x001BA1F2|That statement wrecked the entire foundation of my experiment.
18353|0x001BA23B|That statement wrecked the~entire foundation of my~experiment.
18354|0x001BA293|But if I assume that you aren't a shinigami, I'll have to treat you as~a hallucination then.

18356|0x001BA370|...What? A hallucination?
18357|0x001BA394|...What? A hallucination?
18358|0x001BA3C7|Unfortunately, at this rate you might just turn into a hallucination~of my mind.
18359|0x001BA422|Unfortunately, at this rate you~might just turn into a~hallucination of my mind.
18360|0x001BA497|Wh-Why would I suddenly turn into that?!

18362|0x001BA502|She was panicking.
18363|0x001BA51F|She was panicking.
18364|0x001BA54B|Are you sure that you're not a hallucination?
18365|0x001BA583|Are you sure that you're not a~hallucination?
18366|0x001BA5CA|Of course not! I clearly exist right here in front of you.
18367|0x001BA60F|Of course not! I clearly exist~right here in front of you.
18368|0x001BA659|She may think so, but the thing is, cases of very self-assertive~hallucinations do exist apparently, so I can't trust that.

18370|0x001BA768|Then would you close your eyes so I can prove that you aren't a~hallucination?

18380|0x001BA99A|Yeah.
18381|0x001BA9AA|Yeah.

18384|0x001BAA80|You may, so please do it.

18386|0x001BAAE2|...Okay.

18388|0x001BAB38|Mare nervously closed her eyes.

18390|0x001BABCB|I drew closer to her, positioning myself right in front of her.
18391|0x001BAC15|I drew closer to her,~positioning myself right in~front of her.
18392|0x001BAC7C|Presumably because she heard my footsteps, Mare jerked in surprise.
18393|0x001BACCA|Presumably because she heard my~footsteps, Mare jerked in~surprise.
18394|0x001BAD1D|But she kept her eyes shut as promised.
18395|0x001BAD4F|But she kept her eyes shut as~promised.
18396|0x001BAD86|She was standing there, right before me, with anxiety written all over~her face and tension visible in her shoulders.
18397|0x001BAE06|She was standing there, right~before me, with anxiety written~all over her face and tension~visible in her shoulders.
18398|0x001BAE8B|The thought had entered my mind before, but it reoccurred to me just~how tiny her body was. She wasn't any taller than an elementary~schooler.

18403|0x001BB0AB|And since she was the spitting~image of the girl from the~lookout in my memory, she~looked much younger than me.
18404|0x001BB12B|That's why her tendency to speak like a mature woman gave the~impression that she was putting on an act.

18410|0x001BB319|There was no denying the sensation I felt in my arms.
18411|0x001BB359|There was no denying the~sensation I felt in my arms.
18412|0x001BB39E|I couldn't write off that warmth as a mere hallucination.

18414|0x001BB42B|Her body was soft and warm.

18416|0x001BB47C|Could a sensation like that possibly be an illusion?

18418|0x001BB4FF|Hallucinations aren't just limited to auditory and acoustic kinds.~There are also tactile hallucinations.
18419|0x001BB573|Hallucinations aren't just~limited to auditory and~acoustic kinds. There are also~tactile hallucinations.

18516|0x001BCF81|You seriously... startled me there...
18517|0x001BCFB1|You seriously... startled me~there...
18518|0x001BCFE6|Seeing her make that kind of face made me feel incredibly bad. Well, I~suppose I actually did do something bad to her.

18526|0x001BD29D|No, just listen! I'm not going to hug you again!
18527|0x001BD2D8|No, just listen! I'm not going~to hug you again!

18529|0x001BD36E|Then what's it gonna be this~time, Mister Molester?
18530|0x001BD3B1|In the end, she ended up branding me as a sexual pervert.
18531|0x001BD3F5|In the end, she ended up~branding me as a sexual~pervert.
18532|0x001BD448|Say Mare, do you have any plans for the rest of the day?

18536|0x001BD556|If you have time, would you mind coming over to my house?

18557|0x001BD992|...Why?
18558|0x001BD9C1|Getting all chummy with others happens to be one of the things in this~world I hate most. So, no.

18562|0x001BDB43|That's none of your business.
18563|0x001BDB6B|That's none of your business.
18564|0x001BDBA2|Just for a little bit, all right? If you don't want it getting too~late, swinging by for a cup of tea would be perfectly enough.

18569|0x001BDD77|To figure out if Mare is really~a hallucination.
18570|0x001BDDB7|It would seem there is a natural limit when it comes to clarifying~that all by myself.

18579|0x001BE196|Aren't you treating me a little~too much like your guinea pig~here?
18580|0x001BE1F3|It would certainly serve as an experiment as well, true. However,~there's also the fact that I simply want to invite you to my place.

18592|0x001BE478|Those were my honest feelings.
18593|0x001BE4A1|Those were my honest feelings.
18594|0x001BE4CF|By now, I no longer felt any ill will towards Mare for the fact that~I'd forgotten the lookout girl's name.

18612|0x001BE922|...I won't stand for that.

18625|0x001BEC4B|Huh?
18626|0x001BEC69|I mean, you try to stab me with your scythe at any given opportunity,~and as a matter of fact, you already did stab me once. So yeah, it~just kinda makes me wonder.
18627|0x001BED18|I mean, you try to stab me with~your scythe at any given~opportunity, and as a matter of~fact, you already did stab me
18628|0x001BEDB6|......

18660|0x001BF508|At least she wasn't outright rejecting me, so that was a relief.
18661|0x001BF553|At least she wasn't outright~rejecting me, so that was a~relief.
18662|0x001BF5A3|Because that meant even if she didn't come over to my place, I could~call some other friend to the lookout.

19472|0x001D0187|Kogasaka-san, you ought to use a little bit more discretion when you~joke around.
19473|0x001D01E3|Kogasaka-san, you ought to use~a little bit more discretion~when you joke around.
19474|0x001D024E|...I'm the only one in the wrong here?

19476|0x001D02CF|Yes.

19492|0x001D0625|Take that!

19494|0x001D0654|I got chopped a third time.
19495|0x001D067A|I got chopped a third time.
19496|0x001D06D8|Kosame-san, is there any guy you like?

19504|0x001D0887|Huh...?!

19510|0x001D0994|And the second I thought that, three chops came down in succession.
19511|0x001D09E2|And the second I thought that,~three chops came down in~succession.
19512|0x001D0A6A|...You surprised me so much with that, I forgot to respond~appropriately for a moment.

19514|0x001D0B31|She had her hand placed on her chest.

19516|0x001D0BD0|...You two sure seem like you're having fun.

19518|0x001D0C43|Asuho had entered dog mode.
19519|0x001D0C69|Asuho had entered dog mode.
19520|0x001D0CC1|Asuho wore a complicated expression on her face.

19522|0x001D0DC2|Kosame-kun and I will take the train, so I guess this is where we part~ways.
19523|0x001D0E19|Kosame-kun and I will take the~train, so I guess this is where~we part ways.
19524|0x001D0E8F|All right then, Kogasaka-san, Asuho-san. Have a nice weekend.
19525|0x001D0ED7|All right then, Kogasaka-san,~Asuho-san. Have a nice weekend.
19526|0x001D0F3E|Since Monday's Marine Day, I guess that means it'll be Tuesday when we~next see each other.
19527|0x001D0FA4|Since Monday's Marine Day, I~guess that means it'll be~Tuesday when we next see each~other.
19528|0x001D102B|The two of them headed off in the direction of the station.
19529|0x001D1071|The two of them headed off in~the direction of the station.
19530|0x001D10BC|It was just me and Asuho left standing there.
19531|0x001D10F4|It was just me and Asuho left~standing there.
19532|0x001D1131|Asuho lives in the shopping district, which is nearby to the shopping~district, but she didn't walk with the other two.
19533|0x001D11B3|Asuho lives in the shopping~district, which is nearby to~the shopping district, but she~didn't walk with the other two.
19534|0x001D1272|...So, what are you gonna do?
19535|0x001D129A|...So, what are you gonna do?
19536|0x001D12C7|She sounded a tad sullen.
19537|0x001D12EB|She sounded a tad sullen.
19538|0x001D131E|Regarding Saturday school, you mean?
19539|0x001D134D|Regarding Saturday school, you~mean?
19540|0x001D138D|Yeah.
19541|0x001D139D|Yeah.
19542|0x001D13BC|I guess I'll go. And once it's over, I'll swing by your cafe.
19543|0x001D1404|I guess I'll go. And once it's~over, I'll swing by your cafe.
19544|0x001D146B|Not just that.
19545|0x001D1484|Not just that.
19546|0x001D14A2|Was there something else?
19547|0x001D14C6|Was there something else?
19548|0x001D1509|...I already got the feeling you forgot about it, but now I see you~really did.
19549|0x001D1563|...I already got the feeling~you forgot about it, but now I~see you really did.
19550|0x001D15C2|It hit me when I noticed that Asuho was nearly in dog mode.
19551|0x001D1608|It hit me when I noticed that~Asuho was nearly in dog mode.
19552|0x001D165D|Saturday school in the morning, the explanation regarding the~part-time job in the afternoon, and then I'll go stargazing with you~at night. Does that sound like a plan?
19553|0x001D1711|Saturday school in the morning,~the explanation regarding the~part-time job in the afternoon,~and then I'll go stargazing
19554|0x001D17BF|Absolutely!
19555|0x001D17D5|Absolutely!
19556|0x001D17F0|At once, a smile blossomed on her face.
19557|0x001D1822|At once, a smile blossomed on~her face.
19558|0x001D1859|Apparently I was going to be spending the whole day with Asuho~tomorrow.
19559|0x001D18AC|Apparently I was going to be~spending the whole day with~Asuho tomorrow.
19560|0x001D190E|Do you also want to do some member hunting?
19561|0x001D1944|Do you also want to do some~member hunting?
19562|0x001D1999|Nah, I was just joking back then. I mean, there's hardly any students~that attend Saturday school.
19563|0x001D1A06|Nah, I was just joking back~then. I mean, there's hardly~any students that attend~Saturday school.
19564|0x001D1A78|Which would make handing out flyers rather pointless.
19565|0x001D1AB8|Which would make handing out~flyers rather pointless.
19566|0x001D1B17|How are the prospects with Aoi-san? Pretty grim?
19567|0x001D1B52|How are the prospects with~Aoi-san? Pretty grim?
19568|0x001D1B9C|Seems like it. Every time I mention it to her, she gets really~annoyed.
19569|0x001D1BEE|Seems like it. Every time I~mention it to her, she gets~really annoyed.
19570|0x001D1C5F|If she doesn't want to, that's fine. There's no point in it if she~wouldn't enjoy the club.
19571|0x001D1CC5|If she doesn't want to, that's~fine. There's no point in it if~she wouldn't enjoy the club.
19572|0x001D1D4B|Nevertheless, Asuho wasn't alone. Every member wanted to make sure the~club didn't get abolished.
19573|0x001D1DB7|Nevertheless, Asuho wasn't~alone. Every member wanted to~make sure the club didn't get~abolished.
19574|0x001D1E28|It would be good enough to get Aoi-san to sign up as a paper member,~even if she didn't participate. After all, that's practically what~Setsuna-senpai was doing, and they had no problem with that.
19575|0x001D1EF7|It would be good enough to get~Aoi-san to sign up as a paper~member, even if she didn't~participate. After all, that's
19576|0x001D1F7D|However, that approach surely wouldn't put a smile on Asuho's face.
19577|0x001D1FCB|However, that approach surely~wouldn't put a smile on Asuho's~face.
19578|0x001D2028|Question, Asuho.
19579|0x001D2043|Question, Asuho.
19580|0x001D2095|Yeah?
19581|0x001D20A5|Yeah?
19582|0x001D20C4|Would it hypothetically be possible for someone who isn't a Hibari~High student to join the Astro Club?
19583|0x001D2136|Would it hypothetically be~possible for someone who isn't~a Hibari High student to join~the Astro Club?
19584|0x001D21AD|There was a blank look on Asuho's face.
19585|0x001D21DF|There was a blank look on~Asuho's face.
19586|0x001D2230|Huh... I think it's just common sense that you can't do that.
19587|0x001D2278|Huh... I think it's just common~sense that you can't do that.
19588|0x001D22CF|Is there actually a rule against it, though?
19589|0x001D2306|Is there actually a rule~against it, though?
19590|0x001D235C|I don't know... but I bet if you asked Komomo-chan, she would know.
19591|0x001D23AA|I don't know... but I bet if~you asked Komomo-chan, she~would know.
19592|0x001D2407|Well, even if they aren't a student, wouldn't it be fine if they were~around our age?
19593|0x001D2467|Well, even if they aren't a~student, wouldn't it be fine if~they were around our age?
19594|0x001D24E6|Hmm. I guess you would have to ask someone to be sure.
19595|0x001D2527|Hmm. I guess you would have to~ask someone to be sure.
19596|0x001D2577|It'd be difficult for either of us to get in touch with Hisakaki, so~maybe we could get Kosame-san to do that for us? That would be great.
19597|0x001D260C|It'd be difficult for either of~us to get in touch with~Hisakaki, so maybe we could get~Kosame-san to do that for us?
19598|0x001D26AB|Want me to text her and ask?
19599|0x001D26D2|Want me to text her and ask?
19600|0x001D2708|That would be great.
19601|0x001D2727|That would be great.
19602|0x001D2765|But why do you want to know whether it is or not in the first place?
19603|0x001D27B4|But why do you want to know~whether it is or not in the~first place?
19604|0x001D2827|I gazed up at the sky transitioning from sunset orange to dark night~for a moment before I spoke.
19605|0x001D2893|I gazed up at the sky~transitioning from sunset~orange to dark night for a~moment before I spoke.
19606|0x001D290E|I know someone else, and I have a hunch that they love the stars too.
19607|0x001D295E|I know someone else, and I have~a hunch that they love the~stars too.
19608|0x001D2A32|After saying goodbye to Asuho, I dropped off my school bag at home and~made straight for the lookout. I didn't have to wait for long until my~surroundings had blended into darkness.
19609|0x001D2AF2|After saying goodbye to Asuho,~I dropped off my school bag at~home and made straight for the~lookout. I didn't have to wait
19610|0x001D2B7D|However, since the area was flooded with starlight, that darkness~wasn't as dark as the word implies. It was just very dim.
19611|0x001D2C03|However, since the area was~flooded with starlight, that~darkness wasn't as dark as the~word implies. It was just very
19612|0x001D2C89|Like yesterday, the night sky had once again filled up with twinkling~stars.
19613|0x001D2CE0|Like yesterday, the night sky~had once again filled up with~twinkling stars.
19614|0x001D2D69|Good evening.

19618|0x001D2DDF|Looks like you're still the same blockhead as ever.
19619|0x001D2E1D|Looks like you're still the~same blockhead as ever.
19620|0x001D2E6A|Well, it takes a blockhead to know one.
19621|0x001D2E9C|Well, it takes a blockhead to~know one.
19622|0x001D2EE8|Shall I be leaving now?
19623|0x001D2F0A|Shall I be leaving now?
19624|0x001D2F3B|Already?!
19625|0x001D2F4F|Already?!
19626|0x001D2F68|Mare heaved a light sigh.
19627|0x001D2F8C|Mare heaved a light sigh.
19628|0x001D2FBF|I apologize for fooling around, Mare.
19629|0x001D2FEF|I apologize for fooling around,~Mare.
19630|0x001D302E|I don't really mind that. But I do wanna leave.
19631|0x001D3068|I don't really mind that. But I~do wanna leave.
19632|0x001D30DA|...I mean, my chest hurts.

19634|0x001D3129|She sounded like some girl in love.
19635|0x001D3157|She sounded like some girl in~love.
19636|0x001D3194|Did you catch a cold or something?
19637|0x001D31C1|Did you catch a cold or~something?
19638|0x001D31F3|Apparently, Aoi-san's little sister also had a cold, so maybe there~was something going around.
19639|0x001D325D|Apparently, Aoi-san's little~sister also had a cold, so~maybe there was something going~around.

19642|0x001D3329|But she denied it.
19643|0x001D3346|But she denied it.
19644|0x001D3372|What's wrong then?
19645|0x001D338F|What's wrong then?
19646|0x001D33BB|I wanna reap you so badly I can hardly take it...
19647|0x001D33F7|I wanna reap you so badly I can~hardly take it...
19648|0x001D3438|An impulse to commit murder, then?
19649|0x001D3465|An impulse to commit murder,~then?
19650|0x001D34A1|Can I reap you before I leave?

19652|0x001D3502|...Of course not.
19653|0x001D351E|...Of course not.
19654|0x001D3549|It won't hurt, I promise.
19655|0x001D356D|It won't hurt, I promise.
19656|0x001D35A0|Yeah, I know it doesn't hurt, but you still can't.
19657|0x001D35DD|Yeah, I know it doesn't hurt,~but you still can't.

19660|0x001D36BB|Mare turned her face away, pouting.
19661|0x001D36E9|Mare turned her face away,~pouting.
19662|0x001D371C|Following that, she hugged her scythe.

19664|0x001D378D|You keep trying to see your nighmare.

19670|0x001D3880|It was hardly surprising that she had noticed.
19671|0x001D38B9|It was hardly surprising that~she had noticed.
19672|0x001D38F7|My memories with the girl from the lookout were the nightmare that~Mare kept referring to.

19676|0x001D3A93|I know neither Mare's identity nor what she really is. I also can't~tell whether she is a product of my mind or something real. Either~way, she was definitely trying to steal that memory.

19719|0x001D44CC|...Do you feel that bad?

19734|0x001D498B|Does that mean you can't reap it while I'm thinking about it?
19735|0x001D49D3|Does that mean you can't reap~it while I'm thinking about it?
19736|0x001D4A2A|Not exactly. But I'd rather you not be.
19737|0x001D4A5C|Not exactly. But I'd rather you~not be.

19791|0x001D55FF|...Why did you laugh at that?
19792|0x001D5636|Seriously! Could we agree on not bringing out that scythe for each and~every petty little reason?!
19793|0x001D56A3|Seriously! Could we agree on~not bringing out that scythe~for each and every petty little~reason?!
19794|0x001D572D|I feel like you're making fun of me.
19795|0x001D575C|I feel like you're making fun~of me.
19796|0x001D579A|I'm not. I just thought it was cute when you were acting so childish.
19797|0x001D57EA|I'm not. I just thought it was~cute when you were acting so~childish.
19798|0x001D5873|...So you are making fun of me.
19799|0x001D589D|...So you are making fun of me.
19800|0x001D58CC|But I really didn't mean to tease her. It honestly gave me a sense of~relief.
19801|0x001D5924|But I really didn't mean to~tease her. It honestly gave me~a sense of relief.
19802|0x001D5981|Mare's stuck-up behavior often reminded me of a kid standing on tip~toe trying to look taller. That's the impression she always gave me,~anyway.

19806|0x001D5B07|What is it? Make it quick.
19807|0x001D5B2C|What is it? Make it quick.
19808|0x001D5B60|You love stars, right?
19809|0x001D5B81|You love stars, right?
19810|0x001D5BBF|Maybe.
19811|0x001D5BD0|Maybe.
19812|0x001D5BF0|Then why don't we go stargazing?
19813|0x001D5C1B|Then why don't we go~stargazing?
19814|0x001D5C63|No.
19815|0x001D5C71|No.
19816|0x001D5C84|She shot me down instantly.
19817|0x001D5CAA|She shot me down instantly.
19818|0x001D5CDF|...Why?
19819|0x001D5CF1|...Why?
19820|0x001D5D20|Getting chummy with others happens to be one of the things in this~world I hate most. So, no.
19821|0x001D5D88|Getting chummy with others~happens to be one of the things~in this world I hate most. So,~no.
19822|0x001D5DF5|Come to think of it, she did say that.
19823|0x001D5E26|Come to think of it, she did~say that.
19824|0x001D5E66|In that case, do you want to go stargazing alone with me?
19825|0x001D5EAA|In that case, do you want to go~stargazing alone with me?
19826|0x001D5F0B|...I'm not entirely sure how to interpret that sentence.
19827|0x001D5F4E|...I'm not entirely sure how to~interpret that sentence.
19828|0x001D5FA0|I might happen to be in the vicinity, but it'll be just you looking~through the telescope by yourself. That work for you?
19829|0x001D6024|I might happen to be in the~vicinity, but it'll be just you~looking through the telescope~by yourself. That work for you?
19830|0x001D60C5|No.
19831|0x001D60D3|No.
19832|0x001D60F0|Why?!

19838|0x001D6267|Have you ever done any stargazing before?

19840|0x001D62EC|Not really.
19841|0x001D6302|Not really.
19842|0x001D6327|Wouldn't you like to give it a try at least?
19843|0x001D635E|Wouldn't you like to give it a~try at least?
19844|0x001D63A4|...I don't know.
19845|0x001D63BF|...I don't know.
19846|0x001D63F7|But I can already see the stars this clearly without using a~telescope.
19847|0x001D6449|But I can already see the stars~this clearly without using a~telescope.
19848|0x001D64AA|They'll look even better than this with a telescope, you know.
19849|0x001D64F3|They'll look even better than~this with a telescope, you~know.
19850|0x001D6541|Mare looked up at the night sky and mouthed the words... Even better?
19851|0x001D6591|Mare looked up at the night sky~and mouthed the words... Even~better?
19852|0x001D660E|Like... how much better?
19853|0x001D6631|Like... how much better?
19854|0x001D6663|Hard to say. I haven't really done it myself.
19855|0x001D669B|Hard to say. I haven't really~done it myself.
19856|0x001D66E2|But you wanna try it that badly?
19857|0x001D670D|But you wanna try it that~badly?
19858|0x001D6747|That's precisely why I want to.
19859|0x001D6771|That's precisely why I want to.
19860|0x001D67AA|The way I imagine it, the view I might get could even rival a~kaleidoscope.
19861|0x001D6800|The way I imagine it, the view~I might get could even rival a~kaleidoscope.
19862|0x001D6861|The painting of light that could be seen through its tube is, without~a doubt, in no way less fantastic than a kaleidoscope pattern.

19873|0x001D6B98|Got a problem with that?
19874|0x001D6BCA|Nah, not really. But you're sure missing out.
19875|0x001D6C02|Nah, not really. But you're~sure missing out.
19876|0x001D6C49|Just like you're missing out on so much by not stargazing.
19877|0x001D6C8E|Just like you're missing out on~so much by not stargazing.
19878|0x001D6CF0|Is it that pretty?
19879|0x001D6D0D|Is it that pretty?
19880|0x001D6D39|Yeah. I'll bring one along some time.
19881|0x001D6D69|Yeah. I'll bring one along some~time.
19882|0x001D6D9E|As it happens, our Astro Club was in possession of a kaleidoscope~music box, so I could just borrow it once it got repaired.

19887|0x001D6F35|Mare asked, as if double~checking.
19888|0x001D6F71|Yeah.
19889|0x001D6F81|Yeah.
19890|0x001D6FAE|And you think it will look pretty to me too?
19891|0x001D6FE5|And you think it will look~pretty to me too?
19892|0x001D702B|Yeah.
19893|0x001D703B|Yeah.
19894|0x001D705A|Since you love stars, there's no doubt about it.
19895|0x001D7095|Since you love stars, there's~no doubt about it.
19896|0x001D70E0|Mare nodded in affirmation.

19900|0x001D71D6|Sure thing.

19902|0x001D7207|I heaved a weary sigh of relief inside my mind.
19903|0x001D7241|I heaved a weary sigh of relief~inside my mind.
19904|0x001D7280|Now she would come of her own will.
19905|0x001D72AE|Now she would come of her own~will.
19906|0x001D72E1|In other words, if there was no problem with it in regards to the~school regulations, I could invite Mare into the Astro Club.

19908|0x001D73F2|Which, at the same time, meant I could also have Mare and the other~members meet.
19909|0x001D744E|Which, at the same time, meant~I could also have Mare and the~other members meet.
19910|0x001D74AF|That would clear up any doubts of whether or not Mare was actually a~hallucination.
19911|0x001D750D|That would clear up any doubts~of whether or not Mare was~actually a hallucination.
19912|0x001D7588|...Is there something more to this that you're not telling me?

19940|0x001D7C21|Is telling others your name another of the things you hate?

19942|0x001D7CCA|That's not the problem.

19974|0x001D83F4|What part about I'm not telling you did you not understand?
19975|0x001D843A|What part about I'm not telling~you did you not understand?
19976|0x001D848F|I didn't mean that. The stargazing thing.
19977|0x001D84C3|I didn't mean that. The~stargazing thing.
19978|0x001D8514|......
19979|0x001D8525|......
19980|0x001D8545|If you want, we can even do it tomorrow.
19981|0x001D8578|If you want, we can even do it~tomorrow.
19982|0x001D85C8|...I'll give it some thought.
19983|0x001D85F0|...I'll give it some thought.
19984|0x001D8638|Mare then disappeared.
19985|0x001D8659|Mare then disappeared.
19986|0x001D8692|Asuho and I made arrangements to come look at the stars tomorrow. Here~at this very lookout.
19987|0x001D86F9|Asuho and I made arrangements~to come look at the stars~tomorrow. Here at this very~lookout.
19988|0x001D8765|So Mare would be appearing before Asuho as well.
19989|0x001D87A0|So Mare would be appearing~before Asuho as well.
19990|0x001D87E0|And, I suppose, depending on what becomes of those two coming across~each other, my actions from there might also change.
19991|0x001D8864|And, I suppose, depending on~what becomes of those two~coming across each other, my~actions from there might also
19992|0x001D88EF|Actually... I'm not so sure about that.
19993|0x001D8921|Actually... I'm not so sure~about that.
19994|0x001D8958|It was difficult for me to imagine how my actions would change if Mare~turned out to be a hallucination.
19995|0x001D89CB|It was difficult for me to~imagine how my actions would~change if Mare turned out to be~a hallucination.
19996|0x001D8AA8|Onii-chan, Onii-chan, Onii-chaaaaaan!!
19997|0x001D8AD9|Onii-chan, Onii-chan,~Onii-chaaaaaan!!
19998|0x001D8B66|After dinner, Chinami started hollering and yelling as per usual.

20004|0x001D8CBF|A camera flash hit me right in the face.
20005|0x001D8CF2|A camera flash hit me right in~the face.
20006|0x001D8D34|...What do you want?
20007|0x001D8D53|...What do you want?
20008|0x001D8D91|Guess what! Guess what!! You'll never believe it! Today Occult Prez~gave me a camera! It's an old digital cam he doesn't use anymore! The~second coming of my beloved camera has been realized!!

20013|0x001D8FB7|Oh, yeah? That's pretty cool.~Good for you.
20014|0x001D8FF2|Apparently it was meant to help her do occult club activities.
20015|0x001D903B|Apparently it was meant to help~her do occult club activities.
20016|0x001D9093|You'd better say thank you to Asuka, all right?
20017|0x001D90CD|You'd better say thank you to~Asuka, all right?
20018|0x001D9131|Yep! I absolutely will! After all now with this camera I can prey on~you in your sleep take unbecoming pics of you and use those to~blackmail you into becoming my manslave
20019|0x001D91E9|Yep! I absolutely will! After~all now with this camera I can~prey on you in your sleep take~unbecoming pics of you and use
20020|0x001D92DA|I knocked the camera out of her hands and stepped on it.

20036|0x001D9965|Plummet isn't the correct word. When you subtract a negative from a~negative, you technically do addition. Didn't you learn that?

20060|0x001DA14F|That is just plain false!
20061|0x001DA173|That is just plain false!
20062|0x001DA1B6|I have to agree with Chinami-chan here.
20063|0x001DA1E8|I have to agree with~Chinami-chan here.
20064|0x001DA239|The way I see it, you're always jumping around in high-spirits just as~much as Chinami-chan.

20072|0x001DA54F|Absolutely.
20073|0x001DA565|Absolutely.
20074|0x001DA580|It felt like I just fell into a deep, dark abyss.

20076|0x001DA617|Okay, it's all cleaned up now. Try not to make a mess again, all~right?
20077|0x001DA669|Okay, it's all cleaned up now.~Try not to make a mess again,~all right?
20078|0x001DA6C9|Shino-san left with a warm smile on her face.
20079|0x001DA701|Shino-san left with a warm~smile on her face.
20080|0x001DA771|What's wrong, Onii-chan? It's like there's a dark, gloomy aura oozing~out of you.
20081|0x001DA7CD|What's wrong, Onii-chan? It's~like there's a dark, gloomy~aura oozing out of you.
20082|0x001DA838|I just want to go curl up in a hole somewhere...

20090|0x001DAA1C|I put the trash can on Chinami's head.
20091|0x001DAA4D|I put the trash can on~Chinami's head.
20092|0x001DAA8F|I can't see anything, Onii-chan!! Just 'cause it perfectly fits my~head doesn't justify using it as a helmet! I'll seriously develop~nyctophobia at this rate!!
20093|0x001DAB39|I can't see anything,~Onii-chan!! Just 'cause it~perfectly fits my head doesn't~justify using it as a helmet!
20094|0x001DABC0|Hey, now you've got yourself flawless protection in the event of an~earthquake.
20095|0x001DAC1A|Hey, now you've got yourself~flawless protection in the~event of an earthquake.
20096|0x001DAC8C|How in the heck am I supposed to run away if I can't see anything?!
20097|0x001DACDA|How in the heck am I supposed~to run away if I can't see~anything?!
20098|0x001DAD75|Oh my, the room is full of trash.
20099|0x001DADA1|Oh my, the room is full of~trash.
20100|0x001DADD2|Having seen all the trash that scattered from the trash bin, Shino-san~once again appeared with a broom and a dustpan.

20102|0x001DAEF3|The two of you just get along so well now, don't you?
20103|0x001DAF33|The two of you just get along~so well now, don't you?
20104|0x001DAF78|I felt like fleeing with tears in my eyes.

20106|0x001DB045|It was Saturday.
20107|0x001DB060|It was Saturday.
20108|0x001DB085|It's usually a day that students have off, but apparently Hibari High~has Saturday school.
20109|0x001DB0EA|It's usually a day that~students have off, but~apparently Hibari High has~Saturday school.
20110|0x001DB154|That being the case, I had gotten up bright and early, the same as on~weekdays.
20111|0x001DB1AE|That being the case, I had~gotten up bright and early, the~same as on weekdays.
20112|0x001DB20D|The only difference being that I wasn't kept waiting in suspense by~Chinami sleeping in.
20113|0x001DB270|The only difference being that~I wasn't kept waiting in~suspense by Chinami sleeping~in.
20114|0x001DB2E2|Three cheers for Saturday school.
20115|0x001DB30E|Three cheers for Saturday~school.
20116|0x001DB367|And just when I was enjoying a laid-back morning in the kitchen by~myself, the doorbell rang.

20124|0x001DB5DC|...What are you doing here?
20125|0x001DB602|...What are you doing here?
20126|0x001DB64D|Well, we've gone home together a few times, so it shouldn't be a~surprise I remember where you live.
20127|0x001DB6BC|Well, we've gone home together~a few times, so it shouldn't be~a surprise I remember where you~live.
20128|0x001DB73A|Ah, no, that's not what I was getting at.
20129|0x001DB76E|Ah, no, that's not what I was~getting at.
20130|0x001DB7C1|Oh, you've already got your uniform on, too. I'm proud of you!

20134|0x001DB8FB|So yeah, let's go to school together!
20135|0x001DB92B|So yeah, let's go to school~together!
20136|0x001DB9A4|Let me guess, you thought I'd completely forgotten about Saturday~school?
20137|0x001DB9F8|Let me guess, you thought I'd~completely forgotten about~Saturday school?
20138|0x001DBA51|And she dropped by in order to make sure I wouldn't miss it.
20139|0x001DBA98|And she dropped by in order to~make sure I wouldn't miss it.
20140|0x001DBB16|Ahaha. That's certainly one reason why I've come, but there's also~another.
20141|0x001DBB6C|Ahaha. That's certainly one~reason why I've come, but~there's also another.
20142|0x001DBBD1|Which is?
20143|0x001DBBE5|Which is?
20144|0x001DBC18|Like, this is something I've wanted to do at least once. I mean, going~to the house of a guy to pick him up.
20145|0x001DBC8F|Like, this is something I've~wanted to do at least once. I~mean, going to the house of a~guy to pick him up.
20146|0x001DBD25|To get my first time out of the way, basically.
20147|0x001DBD5F|To get my first time out of the~way, basically.
20148|0x001DBD9E|That had a blatantly sexual undertone to it, but I kept that to~myself.
20149|0x001DBDF0|That had a blatantly sexual~undertone to it, but I kept~that to myself.
20150|0x001DBE47|I didn't want to spoil Asuho's good mood.
20151|0x001DBE7B|I didn't want to spoil Asuho's~good mood.
20152|0x001DBECE|My next objective for first time experiences is entering your house.
20153|0x001DBF1D|My next objective for first~time experiences is entering~your house.
20154|0x001DBF71|Asuho was waiting at the entrance for me to get ready. So technically~she hadn't been inside my house.
20155|0x001DBFE2|Asuho was waiting at the~entrance for me to get ready.~So technically she hadn't been~inside my house.
20156|0x001DC062|You can just accomplish that objective at any time, really.
20157|0x001DC0A8|You can just accomplish that~objective at any time, really.
20158|0x001DC10D|I can?
20159|0x001DC11E|I can?
20160|0x001DC13E|Yeah.
20161|0x001DC14E|Yeah.
20162|0x001DC17D|You mean I can come over whenever I want?
20163|0x001DC1B1|You mean I can come over~whenever I want?
20164|0x001DC1F4|Sure. Even today if you want to.
20165|0x001DC21F|Sure. Even today if you want~to.
20166|0x001DC24F|Asuho shook her head.
20167|0x001DC26F|Asuho shook her head.
20168|0x001DC2AE|It'll feel unrewarding if I experience all of 'em so close to each~other.
20169|0x001DC302|It'll feel unrewarding if I~experience all of 'em so close~to each other.
20170|0x001DC35B|She groaned as she arched her back in a big stretch.
20171|0x001DC39A|She groaned as she arched her~back in a big stretch.
20172|0x001DC3F8|Kosame-chan said she can't come to Saturday school. Apparently she has~to help out at home.
20173|0x001DC45E|Kosame-chan said she can't come~to Saturday school. Apparently~she has to help out at home.
20174|0x001DC4C9|She probably had chores to do.
20175|0x001DC4F2|She probably had chores to do.
20176|0x001DC52A|What about Asuka?
20177|0x001DC546|What about Asuka?
20178|0x001DC581|Hmm. I wouldn't bet on it. I get the feeling he hates school and class~even more than I do.
20179|0x001DC5E7|Hmm. I wouldn't bet on it. I~get the feeling he hates school~and class even more than I do.
20180|0x001DC65C|But you still attend Saturday school, huh?
20181|0x001DC691|But you still attend Saturday~school, huh?
20182|0x001DC6E5|Right. Though I've only been once before.
20183|0x001DC719|Right. Though I've only been~once before.
20184|0x001DC75E|And that time, I was basically telling myself I'd never come again by~the time it was over.
20185|0x001DC7C4|And that time, I was basically~telling myself I'd never come~again by the time it was over.
20186|0x001DC82F|Despite that, she did end up going back to Saturday school for a~second time.
20187|0x001DC887|Despite that, she did end up~going back to Saturday school~for a second time.
20188|0x001DC8E4|I figured it would be rude to ask why. If it was just about her job,~Saturday school wasn't going to stop her from helping out in the~evening anyway.
20189|0x001DC984|I figured it would be rude to~ask why. If it was just about~her job, Saturday school wasn't~going to stop her from helping
20190|0x001DCA0E|Perhaps I just imagined that she went to school for me.
20191|0x001DCA50|Perhaps I just imagined that~she went to school for me.
20192|0x001DCAB1|Oh, and listen to this. Kosame-chan said she'd ask Komomo-chan about~the school's club regulations we talked about yesterday.
20193|0x001DCB39|Oh, and listen to this.~Kosame-chan said she'd ask~Komomo-chan about the school's~club regulations we talked
20194|0x001DCBBF|That would definitely help.
20195|0x001DCBE5|That would definitely help.
20196|0x001DCC2A|So who's that other person you said you might be able to recruit?
20197|0x001DCC76|So who's that other person you~said you might be able to~recruit?
20198|0x001DCCD1|Well, I'll give you more details later.
20199|0x001DCD03|Well, I'll give you more~details later.
20200|0x001DCD3A|I was planning to have her meet Mare during our little stargazing~rendezvous tonight.
20201|0x001DCD9A|I was planning to have her meet~Mare during our little~stargazing rendezvous tonight.
20202|0x001DCE19|Man, I sure hope Saturday school goes by fast, 'cause I'm totally not~ready for this.

20940|0x001EA368|It wouldn't hurt to do some real studying yourself, Asuho. Probably~won't be any customers in the next few hours or so, so I'll be fine by~myself.

20999|0x001EB843|Good for you, You-chan.
21000|0x001EB874|...Hardly. At this rate I'm starting to think I'll be slowly pressured~to work here until I have no choice but to do so.

21004|0x001EB9C0|Asuho looked just as satisfied as him.
21005|0x001EB9F1|Asuho looked just as satisfied~as him.
21006|0x001EBA43|The house area and cafe were connected, with Asuho's room being on the~second floor.

21012|0x001EBC6C|She apparently pulled an all-nighter, so I could understand why she~was so tired.
21013|0x001EBCC8|She apparently pulled an~all-nighter, so I could~understand why she was so~tired.

21035|0x001EC38D|(Huh? What's the apology for?)
21036|0x001EC3BB|At any rate, the blank sheet of paper under Asuho's head was now~covered in drool.
21037|0x001EC418|At any rate, the blank sheet of~paper under Asuho's head was~now covered in drool.
21038|0x001EC4DB|Whoa...! Look at that, You-chan!

21042|0x001EC587|As if to answer our prayers, the sky cleared up after sunset and came~alive with stars.
21043|0x001EC5E9|As if to answer our prayers,~the sky cleared up after sunset~and came alive with stars.
21044|0x001EC650|Coincidentally, that was also around the time Asuho woke up.

21046|0x001EC736|Dinner's out of the way, and all the preparation, too! All we gotta do~now is go get the telescope from the club room.

21050|0x001EC92B|Asuho's dad brought dinner up to Asuho's room. I didn't even have the~time to turn him down, so I just ended up eating it.

21052|0x001ECA3A|I called home afterwards and told Shino-san I wouldn't need dinner~tonight.
21053|0x001ECA90|I called home afterwards and~told Shino-san I wouldn't need~dinner tonight.
21054|0x001ECAEB|I felt a little bad about it, but she just responded by saying, I'm~glad you're making friends.
21055|0x001ECB55|I felt a little bad about it,~but she just responded by~saying, I'm glad you're making~friends.
21056|0x001ECBC4|It sounded like she was actually relieved to see me fitting in so well~in Hibarigasaki.
21057|0x001ECC26|It sounded like she was~actually relieved to see me~fitting in so well in~Hibarigasaki.
21058|0x001ECCBF|All right, let's get this show on the road!

21060|0x001ECD30|So I followed a cheerful Asuho outside.

21064|0x001ECED0|That sentence could have definitely given someone the wrong~impression, so I just hoped that she wouldn't say things like that so~loudly.

21066|0x001ECFE1|I looked up at the night sky overhead.
21067|0x001ED012|I looked up at the night sky~overhead.
21068|0x001ED048|There was a lot of artificial light in the shopping district, so the~starlight came off pretty faint here, but that would change as soon as~we got to the lookout.

21082|0x001ED56A|Just like Chinami, huh?
21083|0x001ED58C|Just like Chinami, huh?
21084|0x001ED5CD|That doesn't change the fact that I'm a girl with no muscle, so I'll~leave carrying my telescope in your hands.

21096|0x001ED913|...Um, I can't imagine them being irresponsible enough to not close~it.
21097|0x001ED965|...Um, I can't imagine them~being irresponsible enough to~not close it.
21098|0x001ED9D6|I'm sure that's the case for schools in urban cities, but you gotta~remember that we're in rural little Hibarigasaki here.

21397|0x001F36DE|So, uh, how do I use them?
21398|0x001F3737|Well, first of all, you tune the width between the eyepieces... yeah,~like that. You do that by turning it.

21400|0x001F3842|After that, here you have knobs for adjusting the focus and~visibility, so you just experiment changing those while gazing at the~star you wanna see.

21406|0x001F3B88|I turned the knobs, adjusting the focus and visibility.

21408|0x001F3C1D|If there's anything you'll really wanna see, I'd say it's the Milky~Way. The area spanning from Cygnus to Sagittarius offers the most~clear view, so go ahead and see what you get.

21412|0x001F3E33|What do you see? Doesn't look like the belt of fog it normally does,~right?
21413|0x001F3E89|What do you see? Doesn't look~like the belt of fog it~normally does, right?
21414|0x001F3EE4|I gradually adjusted the focus.
21415|0x001F3F0E|I gradually adjusted the focus.
21416|0x001F3F49|I'm sure you'll be able to meet tons of stars you couldn't see with~the naked eye there.

21487|0x001F5791|The lookout's been off-limits~for a while now, right?
21488|0x001F57F0|Yeah. Basically by the time I'd even figured out it was there, they'd~already fenced it off.

21526|0x001F639F|I couldn't see Mare anywhere, which made me wonder if she just hadn't~shown up.
21527|0x001F63F9|I couldn't see Mare anywhere,~which made me wonder if she~just hadn't shown up.

21560|0x001F6CF5|What are those?
21561|0x001F6D0F|What are those?
21562|0x001F6D60|We've got a star map, a compass, and a flashlight with cellophane over~it so it doesn't shine too brightly.

21566|0x001F6F10|All right! Time to use the telescope and see the stars in all their~majesty!!
21567|0x001F6F68|All right! Time to use the~telescope and see the stars in~all their majesty!!
21568|0x001F6FC5|I nodded in agreement.
21569|0x001F6FE6|I nodded in agreement.
21570|0x001F702A|I figured that I might as well look at the stars with Asuho while I~was waiting for Mare to show up.

21574|0x001F7209|Yeah, I did. Sorry I stayed out so late.
21575|0x001F723C|Yeah, I did. Sorry I stayed out~so late.
21576|0x001F7274|It was already past ten.

21584|0x001F7478|Usually she would've entered the scene by now with her usual~boisterous antics.
21585|0x001F74D2|Usually she would've entered~the scene by now with her usual~boisterous antics.

21588|0x001F7608|Shino-san then showed me a gentle smile.

21590|0x001F768D|But she fell asleep in the living room. I carried her to her room, so~she's sound asleep in her bed now.
21591|0x001F7700|But she fell asleep in the~living room. I carried her to~her room, so she's sound asleep~in her bed now.

21604|0x001F7BCD|I threw myself down on the bed and stared up at the ceiling.

21606|0x001F7C84|My first ever stargazing experience was fascinating.

21614|0x001F7F8D|It was exeedingly taxing to persuade her.
21615|0x001F7FC1|It was exeedingly taxing to~persuade her.
21616|0x001F7FFA|Thanks to that, while I was carrying the telescope back to Asuho's~home, I ended up making arrangements to go stargazing again with her~tomorrow.

22096|0x00201D6E|Yeah. The two of them run this cafe.
22097|0x00201D9D|Yeah. The two of them run this~cafe.
22098|0x00201DEB|In the beginning, it was just her father by himself. Asuho-san felt~bad seeing how full he had his hands with everything, so she~apparently started to help out of her own accord.

22111|0x00202307|Yeah, when I called your house,~I was told you'd gone over to~Minahoshi-san's place.
22112|0x0020236B|Presumably, Shino-san was the one who answered the phone.

22120|0x0020260D|Yep.

22130|0x00202806|Nothing about it in print, but if you think about it with some common~sense, there's just no way.

22134|0x0020298A|Yep, you've got the right idea. All extracurricular groups fall under~the Student Council's authority.
22135|0x002029FB|Yep, you've got the right idea.~All extracurricular groups fall~under the Student Council's~authority.
22136|0x00202A7B|So in other words, it would be fine so long as they got permission~from the Student Council, right?

22150|0x00202FAD|Thankfully, she caught on quickly.
22151|0x00202FDA|Thankfully, she caught on~quickly.
22152|0x00203016|Exactly that. I want you to add a rule that says people don't~necessarily need to be part of the school to join an extracurricular~group.

22158|0x00203256|Nee-san, I'd also like to second his proposition. All things~considered, I can't see there being any harm so long as the person is~around our age.

22176|0x00203840|No, just that I mean to say the Student Council doesn't have the time~to play around and debate something that absurd.

22178|0x00203951|But how exactly is it absurd?
22179|0x00203979|But how exactly is it absurd?
22180|0x002039C0|Someone who isn't a student of our school can in no way participate in~official athletic competitions. Obviously our school teams would get~disqualified if they had an outsider appear in spite of that.
22181|0x00203A94|Someone who isn't a student of~our school can in no way~participate in official~athletic competitions.
22182|0x00203B14|Well, does it really need to apply to every extracurricular group or~team, though? You can just limit it to the smaller clubs without~advisers, since your objections don't apply to them.

22190|0x00203EEB|The result is already clear as day regardless.
22191|0x00203F24|The result is already clear as~day regardless.
22192|0x00203F6C|You can't say that for certain without giving it a shot, though.
22193|0x00203FB7|You can't say that for certain~without giving it a shot,~though.
22194|0x00204021|If we allow outsiders to join our clubs, what makes them any different~from public clubs of the town? If you're that desperate to make the~Astro Club last, you should have your sights set on the town hall~instead of Hibari High.

22344|0x002072B1|Seeing refers to astronomical seeing conditions that might be hampered~due to things like dust and water vapor up in the atmosphere. If the~seeing is bad, apparently you run into image blurring during~stargazing.

22400|0x002086C6|I'd gotten used to the strap digging into my shoulder too.

22405|0x0020888F|Wouldn't Okaizumi-senpai serve~just as well as me when it~comes to carrying stuff?
22406|0x0020890B|Well, that's what you'd think, but he's got literally zero strength.~This one time I asked him to carry the telescope out of the reference~room when we were cleaning it, and the moment he put it in his hands,~the weight crushed him.
22407|0x002089FE|Well, that's what you'd think,~but he's got literally zero~strength. This one time I asked~him to carry the telescope out

22414|0x00208C2C|So yeah, you're like indispensable for us. So you'd better not give in~to Komomo-chan's temptation, all right?
22415|0x00208CA5|So yeah, you're like~indispensable for us. So you'd~better not give in to~Komomo-chan's temptation, all

22426|0x00209010|Why do you jump to that conclusion?
22427|0x0020903E|Why do you jump to that~conclusion?
22428|0x0020908B|Serving as Student Council member takes more of your time than being a~Library Committee Member or class representative, y'know?
22429|0x00209116|Serving as Student Council~member takes more of your time~than being a Library Committee~Member or class representative,
22430|0x002091A8|Yeah, actually I can imagine that.
22431|0x002091D5|Yeah, actually I can imagine~that.
22432|0x00209221|So no joining them, no matter what. Are we clear?
22433|0x0020925D|So no joining them, no matter~what. Are we clear?
22434|0x002092A8|Well, I'll decide after I've heard all the details from Hisakaki.

22440|0x00209449|Grr.
22441|0x00209458|Grr.
22442|0x00209476|Maybe we should've also invited Kosame-san to come out and stargaze~with us.
22443|0x002094CD|Maybe we should've also invited~Kosame-san to come out and~stargaze with us.
22444|0x00209529|I forcefully changed the topic.
22445|0x00209553|I forcefully changed the topic.
22446|0x0020959C|I imagine she'll probably say no, with some reason like it's too~dangerous or something.
22447|0x002095FF|I imagine she'll probably say~no, with some reason like it's~too dangerous or something.
22448|0x00209671|It would be nice if someday the lookout was open to the public again,~so the whole club could go stargazing there.

22450|0x0020978A|Totally! I'd also settle for claiming permission to use the rooftop~from Komomo-chan.
22451|0x002097EA|Totally! I'd also settle for~claiming permission to use the~rooftop from Komomo-chan.
22452|0x0020984F|I guess that'd become easier to negotiate if the Astro Club got~recognized as an official club.
22453|0x002098B9|I guess that'd become easier to~negotiate if the Astro Club got~recognized as an official club.
22454|0x00209942|That's when our activities will really begin.

22492|0x0020A481|The girl from the lookout would also frequently act like a doting big~sister to me.

22500|0x0020A6F2|Gotcha!

22512|0x0020AA5F|...She's not here.
22513|0x0020AA7C|...She's not here.

22516|0x0020ABCA|Upon returning, I found Asuho fondly looking up at the starlit sky.

22528|0x0020AF2E|It'd be great if we could keep gazing up at the starry sky like this~forever.
22529|0x0020AF86|It'd be great if we could keep~gazing up at the starry sky~like this forever.
22530|0x0020B001|After thirty minutes of waiting, I then started to operate the~telescope, putting into practice what I'd been taught by Asuho last~night.

22781|0x0020FB69|Mare jumped up in surprise as~Asuho's voice reached us from~inside the woods.
22782|0x0020FBF3|She did an about-face, stiff as a robot, and darted away.
22783|0x0020FC37|She did an about-face, stiff as~a robot, and darted away.
22784|0x0020FC80|Though I meant to chase after her, Mare was already long gone.

22788|0x0020FD9B|Asuho ran up to me.
22789|0x0020FDB9|Asuho ran up to me.
22790|0x0020FE1C|You seriously gave me a scare there when you just suddenly took off~running.
22791|0x0020FE73|You seriously gave me a scare~there when you just suddenly~took off running.
22792|0x0020FEDF|Asuho, did you see the girl that was here just now?
22793|0x0020FF1D|Asuho, did you see the girl~that was here just now?
22794|0x0020FF7A|...There was someone there?
22795|0x0020FFA0|...There was someone there?
22796|0x0020FFD5|Yeah. She was at the lookout just now, and I chased after here until~here. You really didn't see her?

22802|0x00210160|Yeah...
22803|0x00210172|Yeah...
22804|0x00210189|Asuho didn't see Mare.
22805|0x002101AA|Asuho didn't see Mare.
22806|0x002101D0|...Or she couldn't see Mare?
22807|0x002101F7|...Or she couldn't see Mare?
22808|0x00210223|Was Asuho simply unable to perceive Mare because she's a figment of my~imagination?
22809|0x00210281|Was Asuho simply unable to~perceive Mare because she's a~figment of my imagination?
22810|0x002102E4|Or was it only a case of Mare having already disappeared before she~could get a glimpse of her?
22811|0x0021034E|Or was it only a case of Mare~having already disappeared~before she could get a glimpse~of her?
22812|0x002103BD|Either way, however, Asuho had at least heard a sound that was~undoubtedly produced by Mare.
22813|0x00210424|Either way, however, Asuho had~at least heard a sound that was~undoubtedly produced by Mare.
22814|0x002104AA|A girl, right?
22815|0x002104C3|A girl, right?
22816|0x002104EB|Yeah. A girl about as small as an elementary schooler.
22817|0x0021052C|Yeah. A girl about as small as~an elementary schooler.
22818|0x0021058C|A girl that young's out at the lookout this late at night?
22819|0x002105D1|A girl that young's out at the~lookout this late at night?
22820|0x00210625|If you put it that way, yeah.
22821|0x0021064D|If you put it that way, yeah.
22822|0x00210694|Oh, so that's why you were chasing after her. You were worried about~her.
22823|0x002106E8|Oh, so that's why you were~chasing after her. You were~worried about her.
22824|0x00210741|That was actually off the mark, but I decided to just leave it at~that.
22825|0x00210793|That was actually off the mark,~but I decided to just leave it~at that.
22826|0x002107F4|Her name's Mare.
22827|0x0021080F|Her name's Mare.
22828|0x00210849|That's a bit of a strange name.
22829|0x00210873|That's a bit of a strange name.
22830|0x002108A2|Asuho tilted her head curiously.
22831|0x002108CD|Asuho tilted her head~curiously.
22832|0x00210917|...Wait, I feel like I've heard that name before.
22833|0x00210953|...Wait, I feel like I've heard~that name before.
22834|0x0021099E|Well yeah, that would be because she's supposedly a shinigami.
22835|0x002109E7|Well yeah, that would be~because she's supposedly a~shinigami.
22836|0x00210A4F|...You mean she's like, a phantom-esque elementary schooler?
22837|0x00210A96|...You mean she's like, a~phantom-esque elementary~schooler?
22838|0x00210AEC|Something like that.
22839|0x00210B0B|Something like that.
22840|0x00210B35|I continued.
22841|0x00210B4C|I continued.
22842|0x00210B72|I want to introduce her to you some time soon, and I'd like you to be~her friend.
22843|0x00210BCE|I want to introduce her to you~some time soon, and I'd like~you to be her friend.
22844|0x00210C71|Sure, I can do that.
22845|0x00210C90|Sure, I can do that.
22846|0x00210CB4|Asuho agreed without a moment's hesitation.
22847|0x00210CEA|Asuho agreed without a moment's~hesitation.
22848|0x00210D25|Quite unlike Mare.
22849|0x00210D42|Quite unlike Mare.
22850|0x00210D93|If she came to the lookout, does that mean she likes the stars? If we~could stargaze together sometime that'd be totally awesome!
22851|0x00210E1F|If she came to the lookout,~does that mean she likes the~stars? If we could stargaze~together sometime that'd be
22852|0x00210E9F|Asuho and I were on the same page.
22853|0x00210ECC|Asuho and I were on the same~page.
22854|0x00210F33|When I returned home after we wrapped up our stargazing and carried~the telescope back to Asuho's place, I found Aoi-san standing outside~my house.
22855|0x00210FD1|When I returned home after we~wrapped up our stargazing and~carried the telescope back to~Asuho's place, I found Aoi-san
22856|0x00211089|...What's wrong?
22857|0x002110A4|...What's wrong?
22858|0x002110C4|Aoi-san cast a sidelong glance at me.
22859|0x002110F4|Aoi-san cast a sidelong glance~at me.
22860|0x00211133|Do you need something at my house?
22861|0x00211160|Do you need something at my~house?
22862|0x002111AC|...Yes.
22863|0x002111BE|...Yes.
22864|0x002111DF|Chinami related?
22865|0x002111FA|Chinami related?
22866|0x00211234|...Correct.
22867|0x0021124A|...Correct.
22868|0x0021126F|Well, I do remember her saying she'd invite you over to our place~today.
22869|0x002112C2|Well, I do remember her saying~she'd invite you over to our~place today.
22870|0x0021131A|I really wanted to ask her why she was standing outside instead of~going in.
22871|0x00211371|I really wanted to ask her why~she was standing outside~instead of going in.
22872|0x002113E7|I turned her down, but...
22873|0x0021140B|I turned her down, but...
22874|0x00211434|Aoi-san sighed.
22875|0x0021144E|Aoi-san sighed.
22876|0x00211487|Apparently, Suzuha went over there while I wasn't at home...
22877|0x002114CE|Apparently, Suzuha went over~there while I wasn't at home...
22878|0x0021151A|Now I understood her predicament.
22879|0x00211546|Now I understood her~predicament.
22880|0x00211581|Wanna come inside then?
22881|0x002115A3|Wanna come inside then?
22882|0x002115E4|...Unfortunately, it seems that I must accept.
22883|0x0021161D|...Unfortunately, it seems that~I must accept.
22884|0x0021165B|(Damn it, Chinami. I specifically told you kidnapping's a crime.)
22885|0x002116A7|(Damn it, Chinami. I~specifically told you~kidnapping's a crime.)
22886|0x00211759|Oh my, a visitor?
22887|0x00211775|Oh my, a visitor?
22888|0x002117A0|Yeah, the neighbor. Her name is...
22889|0x002117CD|Yeah, the neighbor. Her name~is...
22890|0x00211819|Aoi Isuzu-chan, right? We've met a few times on the street and said~hello.
22891|0x0021186E|Aoi Isuzu-chan, right? We've~met a few times on the street~and said hello.
22892|0x002118F0|Aoi-san gave a gentle bow.
22893|0x00211915|Aoi-san gave a gentle bow.
22894|0x0021193F|As the girl living next-door, it makes perfect sense that she already~knew Shino-san.
22895|0x0021199F|As the girl living next-door,~it makes perfect sense that she~already knew Shino-san.
22896|0x00211A1E|Welcome to our house. It's a little late, but tomorrow is a holiday,~so just make yourself feel at home.
22897|0x00211A91|Welcome to our house. It's a~little late, but tomorrow is a~holiday, so just make yourself~feel at home.

22900|0x00211B86|Shino-san, is Chinami here?
22901|0x00211BAC|Shino-san, is Chinami here?
22902|0x00211BF1|Chinami-chan's taking a little nap right now.
22903|0x00211C29|Chinami-chan's taking a little~nap right now.
22904|0x00211CA0|Aoi-san and I followed Shino-san's gaze.
22905|0x00211CD3|Aoi-san and I followed~Shino-san's gaze.
22906|0x00211D24|With her new friend, Suzuha-chan.
22907|0x00211D50|With her new friend,~Suzuha-chan.
22908|0x00211D81|Chinami and Suzuha-chan laid there together, cuddled up next to each~other sound asleep.
22909|0x00211DE4|Chinami and Suzuha-chan laid~there together, cuddled up next~to each other sound asleep.
22910|0x00211E58|The two of them were playing together since noon without a pause. They~must have gotten tired and fallen asleep.
22911|0x00211ED3|The two of them were playing~together since noon without a~pause. They must have gotten~tired and fallen asleep.
22912|0x00211F53|The two of them even held hands.
22913|0x00211F7E|The two of them even held~hands.
22914|0x00211FAE|Just when did Chinami manage to get this close to Suzuha-chan?
22915|0x00211FF7|Just when did Chinami manage to~get this close to Suzuha-chan?
22916|0x00212045|Though, thinking about it, it wasn't all that surprising.
22917|0x00212089|Though, thinking about it, it~wasn't all that surprising.
22918|0x002120DE|...Chinami-san is something else.
22919|0x0021210A|...Chinami-san is something~else.
22920|0x0021213B|Even Aoi-san couldn't help but admire Chinami's power.
22921|0x0021217C|Even Aoi-san couldn't help but~admire Chinami's power.
22922|0x002121CE|This is the first time Suzuha's gotten this attached to someone.
22923|0x00212219|This is the first time Suzuha's~gotten this attached to~someone.
22924|0x00212275|Yesterday was no different. Suzuha is normally a really shy girl~around people she doesn't know, and yet, she immediately became~friends with Chinami-san...
22925|0x0021231C|Yesterday was no different.~Suzuha is normally a really shy~girl around people she doesn't~know, and yet, she immediately
22926|0x002123B1|Well, actually, it didn't happen immediately.
22927|0x002123E9|Well, actually, it didn't~happen immediately.
22928|0x00212432|At first, Suzuha was scared. When Chinami-san came over to play, she~hid herself behind my back and stayed there.
22929|0x002124AE|At first, Suzuha was scared.~When Chinami-san came over to~play, she hid herself behind my~back and stayed there.
22930|0x0021253B|I tried to send her away. But Chinami just wouldn't go, no matter~what.
22931|0x0021258D|I tried to send her away. But~Chinami just wouldn't go, no~matter what.
22932|0x002125F0|She just said, 'Let's eat these together', and she took out a bundle~of souffles.
22933|0x0021264C|She just said, 'Let's eat these~together', and she took out a~bundle of souffles.
22934|0x002126B9|She started to eat them right there in front of us.
22935|0x002126F7|She started to eat them right~there in front of us.
22936|0x00212746|Suzuha was surprised, but I was mostly just annoyed.
22937|0x00212785|Suzuha was surprised, but I was~mostly just annoyed.
22938|0x002127D5|Yet Chinami-san kept going on and on about how tasty the souffles were~while eating them blissfully.
22939|0x00212844|Yet Chinami-san kept going on~and on about how tasty the~souffles were while eating them~blissfully.
22940|0x002128C4|I think that's what piqued Suzuha's interest.
22941|0x002128FC|I think that's what piqued~Suzuha's interest.
22942|0x00212945|She carefully approached Chinami-san, and she handed her a souffle~with a smile on her face so blithe, and so absentmindedly happy...
22943|0x002129D5|She carefully approached~Chinami-san, and she handed her~a souffle with a smile on her~face so blithe, and so
22944|0x00212A5E|Suzuha said they were tasty, too...
22945|0x00212A8C|Suzuha said they were tasty,~too...
22946|0x00212ACB|And the next thing I knew, Suzuha was smiling along with her.
22947|0x00212B13|And the next thing I knew,~Suzuha was smiling along with~her.
22948|0x00212B60|I could see the emotions of both admiration and exasperated disbelief~on her face.
22949|0x00212BBD|I could see the emotions of~both admiration and exasperated~disbelief on her face.
22950|0x00212C2B|How could Chinami-san have possibly known that Suzuha loves~souffles...?
22951|0x00212C7E|How could Chinami-san have~possibly known that Suzuha~loves souffles...?
22952|0x00212CE2|I can't think of it as anything but mere happenstance...
22953|0x00212D25|I can't think of it as anything~but mere happenstance...
22954|0x00212D7D|It wasn't happenstance.

22956|0x00212E02|...Huh?
22957|0x00212E14|...Huh?

22962|0x00212FC3|Exactly. Chinami-chan came to me and asked me about you two.
22963|0x0021300A|Exactly. Chinami-chan came to~me and asked me about you two.
22964|0x00213062|I suppose she must have realized it from how I made souffles in~particular to hand over as the greeting gift the other day.
22965|0x002130E8|I suppose she must have~realized it from how I made~souffles in particular to hand~over as the greeting gift the
22966|0x00213182|I've talked with your parents on several occasions, and they've told~me things about you.
22967|0x002131E6|I've talked with your parents~on several occasions, and~they've told me things about~you.

22972|0x0021339E|That well-deserved title comes from real effort on her part.
22973|0x002133E5|That well-deserved title comes~from real effort on her part.
22974|0x0021343B|So yeah, I'm sure next will be your turn.
22975|0x0021346F|So yeah, I'm sure next will be~your turn.
22976|0x002134B4|...?
22977|0x002134C3|...?
22978|0x002134E1|Before you even know it, you two will be like peas in a pod.

22982|0x002135C1|We'll see about that.
22983|0x002135E1|We'll see about that.
22984|0x00213612|It's impossible.
22985|0x0021362D|It's impossible.
22986|0x0021364D|It was quite unusual for Aoi-san to raise her voice like that.

22990|0x00213768|Aoi-san's words were the polar opposite to Asuho's when she~unhesitatingly agreed to be friends with Mare, displaying not even a~trace of reluctance whatsoever.

22996|0x00213A0E|Much like I did in the past.

22998|0x00213ABB|On that day, it was a national holiday  Marine Day.

23488|0x0021DD73|Regardless, Chinami's good mood was back by the time we set off, with~her in tow.
23489|0x0021DDCF|Regardless, Chinami's good mood~was back by the time we set~off, with her in tow.
23490|0x0021DEB3|Wow...! So this is what the lookout's like at night.
23491|0x0021DEF2|Wow...! So this is what the~lookout's like at night.
23492|0x0021DF46|Pretty magnificent, don't you think? You definitely can't see the~stars like this in the city.

23494|0x0021E050|Ahaha, he's bragging now.

23496|0x0021E0C0|Chinami still had her eyes fixated on the night sky overhead. Asuho~gleefully began to set up the telescope.

23498|0x0021E1D2|I, on the other hand, went to search for Mare.
23499|0x0021E20B|I, on the other hand, went to~search for Mare.
23500|0x0021E249|I surveyed the area. She could have been hiding anywhere, so I~strained my ears to hear as I walked around.
23501|0x0021E2BF|I surveyed the area. She could~have been hiding anywhere, so I~strained my ears to hear as I~walked around.
23502|0x0021E33A|I wouldn't let the slightest peep escape my keen ears.
23503|0x0021E37B|I wouldn't let the slightest~peep escape my keen ears.
23504|0x0021E3C1|While I did find Mare last night, she ultimately ended up running~away.
23505|0x0021E413|While I did find Mare last~night, she ultimately ended up~running away.
23506|0x0021E46A|She disappeared before I could get her to meet Asuho.
23507|0x0021E4AA|She disappeared before I could~get her to meet Asuho.
23508|0x0021E4EF|So, if I found Mare, I had to make her stay as long as possible.
23509|0x0021E53A|So, if I found Mare, I had to~make her stay as long as~possible.
23510|0x0021E58A|...It would have been easier if I just captured her.
23511|0x0021E5C9|...It would have been easier if~I just captured her.
23512|0x0021E60D|However, even if I did catch her, she could easily escape.
23513|0x0021E652|However, even if I did catch~her, she could easily escape.
23514|0x0021E69C|After all, she could literally just disappear.
23515|0x0021E6D5|After all, she could literally~just disappear.
23516|0x0021E713|Above all, Mare is different from animals like dogs and cats. Catching~her isn't an appropriate expression.
23517|0x0021E789|Above all, Mare is different~from animals like dogs and~cats. Catching her isn't an~appropriate expression.
23518|0x0021E804|Even if it is dubious whether she is even a human being...

23520|0x0021E893|Above all else, Mare is my friend.
23521|0x0021E8C0|Above all else, Mare is my~friend.
23522|0x0021E8F2|At this point, there's no reason not to think of her as a friend.
23523|0x0021E93E|At this point, there's no~reason not to think of her as a~friend.
23524|0x0021E98F|Regardless of the fact that she stabbed me and stole my memories from~me, my desire to see her was genuine.
23525|0x0021EA05|Regardless of the fact that she~stabbed me and stole my~memories from me, my desire to~see her was genuine.

23527|0x0021EACE|Hence, regardless of what she~might think of me, Mare is my~friend.
23528|0x0021EB21|So...

23530|0x0021EB4C|So what do I have to do in order to convince a friend to stay by my~side?
23531|0x0021EBA0|So what do I have to do in~order to convince a friend to~stay by my side?
23532|0x0021EBF9|The girl from the lookout herself taught me the answer to that~question.
23533|0x0021EC4C|The girl from the lookout~herself taught me the answer to~that question.

23600|0x0021FB53|Why?
23601|0x0021FB62|Why?
23602|0x0021FB80|Because I had a similar experience in the past.

23610|0x0021FDBB|With Mare, if I were to identify a difference between her and my past~self, it'd be that Mare doesn't outright reject the idea of making~friends.

23800|0x00223002|The heck?
23801|0x00223016|The heck?
23802|0x00223049|This girl disappeared right before my very eyes. Kinda like, y'know,~when something dissolves into air all suddenly.
23803|0x002230C8|This girl disappeared right~before my very eyes. Kinda~like, y'know, when something~dissolves into air all
23804|0x00223142|The other two only tilted their heads in confusion after hearing~Asuho's explanation that skipped over all the preceding details.
23805|0x002231CE|The other two only tilted their~heads in confusion after~hearing Asuho's explanation~that skipped over all the
23806|0x00223266|Thanks to that I just couldn't set my mind to studying at all, y'know?
23807|0x002232B7|Thanks to that I just couldn't~set my mind to studying at all,~y'know?
23808|0x0022330D|For some reason, she didn't seem too disappointed about all the~studying she missed out on.
23809|0x00223373|For some reason, she didn't~seem too disappointed about all~the studying she missed out on.
23810|0x00223414|Yeah, so when I fail my exams it'll be all your fault, You-chan.
23811|0x0022345F|Yeah, so when I fail my exams~it'll be all your fault,~You-chan.
23812|0x002234B9|...That definitely won't be my fault.
23813|0x002234E9|...That definitely won't be my~fault.
23814|0x00223538|Take responsibility, okay?
23815|0x0022355D|Take responsibility, okay?
23816|0x00223587|Her joyful tone didn't match her words.
23817|0x002235B9|Her joyful tone didn't match~her words.
23818|0x00223626|I don't quite understand what you said, but... Did you perchance~stumble across an invisible person yesterday?
23819|0x0022369F|I don't quite understand what~you said, but... Did you~perchance stumble across an~invisible person yesterday?
23820|0x0022374F|Can't take any pics of them if they're invisible, talk about lame.
23821|0x0022379C|Can't take any pics of them if~they're invisible, talk about~lame.
23822|0x00223808|That's not quite right. According to You-chan, she's a shinigami,~right?
23823|0x0022385B|That's not quite right.~According to You-chan, she's a~shinigami, right?
23824|0x002238BD|Well, that's what she herself claims.
23825|0x002238ED|Well, that's what she herself~claims.
23826|0x00223958|A shinigami? Whoa! From Hibari High's urban legend?
23827|0x00223996|A shinigami? Whoa! From Hibari~High's urban legend?
23828|0x002239D9|Now we had piqued Asuka's interest.
23829|0x00223A07|Now we had piqued Asuka's~interest.
23830|0x00223A54|Do you know?
23831|0x00223A6B|Do you know?
23832|0x00223A91|Never really asked her about that.
23833|0x00223ABE|Never really asked her about~that.
23834|0x00223B0A|With a scythe that big, like, she just has to be the one!
23835|0x00223B4E|With a scythe that big, like,~she just has to be the one!
23836|0x00223B97|Asuho was surprisingly nonchalant about the whole thing considering~that she just witnessed some paranormal activity.
23837|0x00223C17|Asuho was surprisingly~nonchalant about the whole~thing considering that she just~witnessed some paranormal
23838|0x00223C92|As for the other witness, Chinami, she brought up the theory that Mare~was alien and got all hyped up about the prospect of becoming friends~with her.
23839|0x00223D33|As for the other witness,~Chinami, she brought up the~theory that Mare was alien and~got all hyped up about the
23840|0x00223DCC|And you're telling me y'all saw that shinigami?
23841|0x00223E06|And you're telling me y'all saw~that shinigami?
23842|0x00223E4F|Yeah.
23843|0x00223E5F|Yeah.
23844|0x00223E8E|Where at?
23845|0x00223EA2|Where at?
23846|0x00223ED5|At the lookout. You know, the place they made off-limits.
23847|0x00223F19|At the lookout. You know, the~place they made off-limits.
23848|0x00223F7C|And you guys went in anyway?
23849|0x00223FA3|And you guys went in anyway?
23850|0x00223FE9|Yeah, but don't tell anyone about it.
23851|0x00224019|Yeah, but don't tell anyone~about it.
23852|0x00224058|We haven't caused any problems or anything. We only go there to see~the stars.
23853|0x002240B1|We haven't caused any problems~or anything. We only go there~to see the stars.
23854|0x00224129|And the little shinigami girl, Mare-chan, oh let me tell you, she was~sooo into it!
23855|0x00224187|And the little shinigami girl,~Mare-chan, oh let me tell you,~she was sooo into it!
23856|0x00224222|So the shinigami's name is Mare, all right.
23857|0x00224258|So the shinigami's name is~Mare, all right.
23858|0x00224293|He was jotting down notes.
23859|0x002242B8|He was jotting down notes.
23860|0x00224333|...Did the both of you truly see that shinigami?
23861|0x0022436E|...Did the both of you truly~see that shinigami?
23862|0x002243AE|Kosame-san asked for confirmation in a bewildered tone.
23863|0x002243F0|Kosame-san asked for~confirmation in a bewildered~tone.
23864|0x00224451|Yeah. Though we didn't get to talk a whole lot with her.
23865|0x00224494|Yeah. Though we didn't get to~talk a whole lot with her.
23866|0x002244E6|Yep, she just up and disappeared right after she was done looking at~the stars.
23867|0x00224540|Yep, she just up and~disappeared right after she was~done looking at the stars.
23868|0x002245E4|The shinigami is interested in the stars. Got it.
23869|0x00224620|The shinigami is interested in~the stars. Got it.
23870|0x00224661|He wrote that down too.
23871|0x00224683|He wrote that down too.
23872|0x002246FB|And... it would be safe to say that there was no chance you two were~merely seeing something along the lines of a dream?
23873|0x0022477E|And... it would be safe to say~that there was no chance you~two were merely seeing~something along the lines of a
23874|0x00224819|Both You-chan and Chinami-chan also saw her, so it definitely wasn't a~dream.
23875|0x00224871|Both You-chan and Chinami-chan~also saw her, so it definitely~wasn't a dream.
23876|0x002248E8|It is possible, though, that all three of you had the same dream.
23877|0x00224934|It is possible, though, that~all three of you had the same~dream.
23878|0x00224985|Kosame-san's remark got me thinking.
23879|0x002249B4|Kosame-san's remark got me~thinking.
23880|0x002249E8|...Right. It's also possible that it was a collective hallucination.
23881|0x00224A37|...Right. It's also possible~that it was a collective~hallucination.
23882|0x00224A8B|However, I just don't feel that Mare's a hallucination.
23883|0x00224ACD|However, I just don't feel that~Mare's a hallucination.
23884|0x00224B14|Maybe it's just my wishful thinking, but I believe that Mare really~does exist at that lookout.
23885|0x00224B7E|Maybe it's just my wishful~thinking, but I believe that~Mare really does exist at that~lookout.
23886|0x00224C32|So not only you saw her, but Chinami-chan did, too?
23887|0x00224C70|So not only you saw her, but~Chinami-chan did, too?
23888|0x00224CBD|Yeah. The three of us went stargazing together.
23889|0x00224CF7|Yeah. The three of us went~stargazing together.
23890|0x00224D50|If you're not pulling my leg, guess I also gotta stakeout at the~lookout some time here soon. As a member of an Occult Club, no way in~hell I can just ignore something like this.
23891|0x00224E0D|If you're not pulling my leg,~guess I also gotta stakeout at~the lookout some time here~soon. As a member of an Occult
23892|0x00224EC6|Eh, really?
23893|0x00224EDC|Eh, really?
23894|0x00224F11|What, I'm not allowed to go check it out?!
23895|0x00224F46|What, I'm not allowed to go~check it out?!
23896|0x00224F9A|It's such a beautiful, romantic spot up there, so tarnishing something~that pure with your occult stuff is just... Ugh...
23897|0x0022501E|It's such a beautiful, romantic~spot up there, so tarnishing~something that pure with your~occult stuff is just... Ugh...
23898|0x002250C1|Oh, I get it. You just wanna be all alone with Kogasaka.
23899|0x00225104|Oh, I get it. You just wanna be~all alone with Kogasaka.
23900|0x00225170|Wha?! N-No, why would you think that?!
23901|0x002251A3|Wha?! N-No, why would you~think that?!
23902|0x00225219|...Are you planning to go there again tonight?
23903|0x00225252|...Are you planning to go there~again tonight?
23904|0x0022529A|Do you want to, Asuho? Your call.
23905|0x002252C6|Do you want to, Asuho? Your~call.
23906|0x00225311|Ah, s-sure. Goes without saying!
23907|0x0022533C|Ah, s-sure. Goes without~saying!
23908|0x00225376|There you have it. If you want to, why don't you come along, too? We'd~love to have you.
23909|0x002253D9|There you have it. If you want~to, why don't you come along,~too? We'd love to have you.
23910|0x00225441|Kosame-san shook her head.
23911|0x00225466|Kosame-san shook her head.
23912|0x002254AA|The area is off-limits, so I can't help but imagine it must be~dangerous...
23913|0x00225500|The area is off-limits, so I~can't help but imagine it must~be dangerous...
23914|0x00225575|It seemed perfectly okay to me. I mean, the footing isn't bad either.
23915|0x002255C5|It seemed perfectly okay to me.~I mean, the footing isn't bad~either.
23916|0x00225634|Asuho-san, are you sure studying shouldn't take precedence over that?~We have exams to take this entire week.
23917|0x002256AC|Asuho-san, are you sure~studying shouldn't take~precedence over that? We have~exams to take this entire week.
23918|0x00225729|Kosame-san was pretty against the idea.
23919|0x0022575B|Kosame-san was pretty against~the idea.
23920|0x002257AC|We get out of school earlier during finals week, so if we study from~around noon until evening, and then go stargazing afterwards, it'll~serve as a nice breather. The perfect plan!
23921|0x0022586B|We get out of school earlier~during finals week, so if we~study from around noon until~evening, and then go stargazing
23922|0x0022590B|Don't we have to hunt for Astro Club members in the time before~evening?
23923|0x0022595E|Don't we have to hunt for Astro~Club members in the time before~evening?
23924|0x002259D0|Ahh!! Crap I totally forgot!
23925|0x002259F7|Ahh!! Crap I totally forgot!
23926|0x00225A2D|...Sheesh, what are you doing forgetting something like that? You're~the Vice Prez.
23927|0x00225A8B|...Sheesh, what are you doing~forgetting something like that?~You're the Vice Prez.
23928|0x00225B29|It's aight, you just be a good little student and study for those~exams. I'll say hello to the shinigami for ya.
23929|0x00225BA4|It's aight, you just be a good~little student and study for~those exams. I'll say hello to~the shinigami for ya.
23930|0x00225C3E|Don't just assume I'm not going! I did more than enough studying over~our three days off school!
23931|0x00225CA9|Don't just assume I'm not~going! I did more than enough~studying over our three days~off school!
23932|0x00225D19|As I remember it, though, she spent two of those study sessions~napping.
23933|0x00225D6C|As I remember it, though, she~spent two of those study~sessions napping.
23934|0x00225DDE|You'll back me up, right, You-chan?
23935|0x00225E0C|You'll back me up, right,~You-chan?
23936|0x00225E49|If you won't blame me after you fail your exams, then sure I'll go.
23937|0x00225E97|If you won't blame me after you~fail your exams, then sure I'll~go.
23938|0x00225EEA|Above all, I wanted to see Mare, too.
23939|0x00225F1A|Above all, I wanted to see~Mare, too.
23940|0x00225F96|...My opinion doesn't seem to hold much weight when I'm the only one~opposd.
23941|0x00225FED|...My opinion doesn't seem to~hold much weight when I'm the~only one opposd.
23942|0x00226049|Kosame-san had given in, too.
23943|0x00226071|Kosame-san had given in, too.
23944|0x002260D2|So you're gonna come with us, Kosame-chan?
23945|0x00226107|So you're gonna come with us,~Kosame-chan?
23946|0x0022615B|As much as I'd like to, I don't quite think I'll be able to.
23947|0x002261A2|As much as I'd like to, I don't~quite think I'll be able to.
23948|0x00226208|That's all right, you gotta study for the exams, after all. We'll just~put it off for when our exams are over then.
23949|0x00226286|That's all right, you gotta~study for the exams, after all.~We'll just put it off for when~our exams are over then.
23950|0x00226323|I still don't think that would change the situation.
23951|0x00226362|I still don't think that would~change the situation.
23952|0x002263C0|Huh? Why?
23953|0x002263D4|Huh? Why?
23954|0x002263ED|Kosame-san seemed apologetic.
23955|0x00226415|Kosame-san seemed apologetic.
23956|0x0022645C|You still can't get the idea of the lookout being dangerous out of~your head?
23957|0x002264B4|You still can't get the idea of~the lookout being dangerous out~of your head?
23958|0x0022652B|Rather, it's because I'm also on Nee-san's side.
23959|0x00226566|Rather, it's because I'm also~on Nee-san's side.
23960|0x002265B0|You mean because Hisakaki would be against it?
23961|0x002265E9|You mean because Hisakaki would~be against it?
23962|0x00226641|You could say so.
23963|0x0022665D|You could say so.
23964|0x00226698|And that even though you're an Astro Club member...
