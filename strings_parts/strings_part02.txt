5912|0x000AD1F0|Because of that, the bottom of one of your boxes completely gave out~and your stuff spilled out all over the place. I feel sorry for those~poor guys.

5966|0x000AE7B2|For that reason, and also because I'd always lived in apartments in~Hibarigasaki and the city, I felt a strange sense of excitement to be~living in a real house.

7049|0x000C4D9F|You said you've been waiting~for me... since when exactly?
7050|0x000C4DFE|Were you not listening? Since long ago.
7051|0x000C4E30|Were you not listening? Since~long ago.
7052|0x000C4E71|How many years ago exactly?
7053|0x000C4E97|How many years ago exactly?
7054|0x000C4ECC|I've forgotten.
7055|0x000C4EE6|I've forgotten.
7056|0x000C4F0F|Let's just say hypothetically it was seven years ago. How old would~you have been then?
7057|0x000C4F71|Let's just say hypothetically~it was seven years ago. How old~would you have been then?
7058|0x000C4FE2|I have no age or anything of the sort.
7059|0x000C5013|I have no age or anything of~the sort.
7060|0x000C5049|(...Uh, what?)
7061|0x000C5062|(...Uh, what?)
7062|0x000C508A|So, I wasn't a baby at the time we met. Got that?
7063|0x000C50C6|So, I wasn't a baby at the time~we met. Got that?
7064|0x000C5111|...H-Hold on a second.
7065|0x000C5132|...H-Hold on a second.
7066|0x000C5158|(Uh, what did she just say?)
7067|0x000C517F|(Uh, what did she just say?)
7068|0x000C51AB|(She doesn't have an age?)
7069|0x000C51D0|(She doesn't have an age?)
7070|0x000C5204|No age...? But what does that even mean?
7071|0x000C5237|No age...? But what does that~even mean?
7072|0x000C5279|Exactly what I said.
7073|0x000C5298|Exactly what I said.
7074|0x000C52C6|...I'd really appreciate it if you could explain that in a way I can~actually understand.
7075|0x000C532A|...I'd really appreciate it if~you could explain that in a way~I can actually understand.
7076|0x000C539D|I don't believe that there is any further explanation.
7077|0x000C53DE|I don't believe that there is~any further explanation.
7078|0x000C542E|I mean, something like you don't age because you're a shinigami, for~instance.
7079|0x000C5487|I mean, something like you~don't age because you're a~shinigami, for instance.
7080|0x000C54E5|That was something that sprung to mind due to the outfit of the girl~in front of me... of Mare.
7081|0x000C554F|That was something that sprung~to mind due to the outfit of~the girl in front of me... of~Mare.
7082|0x000C55D3|Shinigami...
7083|0x000C55EA|Shinigami...
7084|0x000C5606|Seeming like she was ruminating over whether or not she was, Mare~pensively repeated it to herself.
7085|0x000C5674|Seeming like she was ruminating~over whether or not she was,~Mare pensively repeated it to~herself.
7086|0x000C570E|If that would convince you, then you may call me a shinigami.
7087|0x000C5756|If that would convince you,~then you may call me a~shinigami.
7088|0x000C57A3|She accepted that label without argument.
7089|0x000C57D7|She accepted that label without~argument.
7090|0x000C581A|So basically, you don't age because you're a shinigami, and because of~that, your appearance hasn't changed since we last met?
7091|0x000C58A3|So basically, you don't age~because you're a shinigami, and~because of that, your~appearance hasn't changed since
7092|0x000C5939|It would appear so.
7093|0x000C5957|It would appear so.
7094|0x000C5984|B-But I mean... are you really a shinigami?
7095|0x000C59BA|B-But I mean... are you really~a shinigami?
7096|0x000C5A0A|You were the one who called me that.
7097|0x000C5A39|You were the one who called me~that.
7098|0x000C5A77|But do you mean THAT shinigami?
7099|0x000C5AA1|But do you mean THAT shinigami?
7100|0x000C5ADA|I don't know what kind of shinigami you mean, but if I am what you~call a shinigami, then I am the only shinigami by the name of Mare.
7101|0x000C5B6B|I don't know what kind of~shinigami you mean, but if I am~what you call a shinigami, then~I am the only shinigami by the
7102|0x000C5BF3|At this point, I'd started to feel like I was having a philosophical~debate or something.
7103|0x000C5C57|At this point, I'd started to~feel like I was having a~philosophical debate or~something.
7104|0x000C5CCA|Oh, I see.
7105|0x000C5CDF|Oh, I see.
7106|0x000C5CF9|I now finally felt like I understood what she'd been trying to say.
7107|0x000C5D47|I now finally felt like I~understood what she'd been~trying to say.
7108|0x000C5DA4|Is that a shinigami cosplay?
7109|0x000C5DCB|Is that a shinigami cosplay?
7110|0x000C5E0C|Cos... play?
7111|0x000C5E23|Cos... play?
7112|0x000C5E49|I've heard of shinigami characters in anime. You're saying that you~aren't cosplaying as any them because you made your own character.~You're dressed up as your own original character, right?
7113|0x000C5F13|I've heard of shinigami~characters in anime. You're~saying that you aren't~cosplaying as any them because
7114|0x000C5FA1|I don't know what you're saying.
7115|0x000C5FCC|I don't know what you're~saying.
7116|0x000C6006|That scythe is artificial, right?
7117|0x000C6032|That scythe is artificial,~right?
7118|0x000C606D|Since it clearly exists right here, I suppose it must have been made~by someone. So yes, it is artificial.
7119|0x000C60E2|Since it clearly exists right~here, I suppose it must have~been made by someone. So yes,~it is artificial.
7120|0x000C6166|It's not a real scythe though, right?
7121|0x000C6196|It's not a real scythe though,~right?
7122|0x000C61D5|I don't know what you have in mind with that, but to me, it's~one-of-a-kind, so I suppose it is 'real'.
7123|0x000C6247|I don't know what you have in~mind with that, but to me, it's~one-of-a-kind, so I suppose it~is 'real'.
7124|0x000C62C8|But surely it isn't actually sharp, right?
7125|0x000C62FD|But surely it isn't actually~sharp, right?
7126|0x000C6341|It is very sharp.
7127|0x000C635D|It is very sharp.
7128|0x000C637E|She declared it with confidence.
7129|0x000C63A9|She declared it with~confidence.
7130|0x000C63E3|Wanna see for yourself?
7131|0x000C6405|Wanna see for yourself?
7132|0x000C6436|Wait, wait! Hold up! If you actually cut me with that thing, it's not~going to be funny anymore!
7133|0x000C64A1|Wait, wait! Hold up! If you~actually cut me with that~thing, it's not going to be~funny anymore!
7134|0x000C651B|I got the impression you wanted me to cut you. You don't?
7135|0x000C655F|I got the impression you wanted~me to cut you. You don't?
7136|0x000C65B2|It'd make you a real shinigami if I ended up dying from that, right?!
7137|0x000C6602|It'd make you a real shinigami~if I ended up dying from that,~right?!
7138|0x000C668A|I AM a shinigami. How can you not acknowledge that even though you are~the one who called me one first?
7139|0x000C66FC|I AM a shinigami. How can you~not acknowledge that even~though you are the one who~called me one first?
7140|0x000C6773|She was getting upset with me.
7141|0x000C679C|She was getting upset with me.
7142|0x000C67CA|She had finally revealed an expression befitting her age. Her anger~took me aback for a second, but it also brought a sense of relief.
7143|0x000C685B|She had finally revealed an~expression befitting her age.~Her anger took me aback for a~second, but it also brought a
7144|0x000C68E0|Contrary to her looks, she did have a more mature sort of vibe.
7145|0x000C692A|Contrary to her looks, she did~have a more mature sort of~vibe.
7146|0x000C6979|Especially in the way she talked.
7147|0x000C69A5|Especially in the way she~talked.
7148|0x000C69D6|It was completely different from how the lookout girl used to talk.
7149|0x000C6A24|It was completely different~from how the lookout girl used~to talk.
7150|0x000C6A77|All of that led me to believe that she wasn't her after all.
7151|0x000C6ABE|All of that led me to believe~that she wasn't her after all.
7152|0x000C6B14|Okay, Mare-chan... For now, let's assume that you are in fact a~shinigami.
7153|0x000C6B69|Okay, Mare-chan... For now,~let's assume that you are in~fact a shinigami.
7154|0x000C6BCD|...You called me chan.
7155|0x000C6BEE|...You called me chan.
7156|0x000C6C14|That made her even more irritated with me.
7157|0x000C6C49|That made her even more~irritated with me.
7158|0x000C6C98|I'm supposed to be the big sister here, and yet you treat me like~that...
7159|0x000C6CEC|I'm supposed to be the big~sister here, and yet you treat~me like that...
7160|0x000C6D45|Although she wasn't the girl from the lookout, the way Mare said that~reminded me of the girl from the lookout.
7161|0x000C6DBF|Although she wasn't the girl~from the lookout, the way Mare~said that reminded me of the~girl from the lookout.
7162|0x000C6E48|But it's not like you could actually be older than me, right?
7163|0x000C6E90|But it's not like you could~actually be older than me,~right?
7164|0x000C6EF2|Why not?
7165|0x000C6F05|Why not?
7166|0x000C6F27|Okay then, I know I already asked you this a little while ago, but how~old are you?
7167|0x000C6F85|Okay then, I know I already~asked you this a little while~ago, but how old are you?
7168|0x000C6FFD|Shinigami don't have an age.
7169|0x000C7024|Shinigami don't have an age.
7170|0x000C705A|...Which school do you go to?
7171|0x000C7082|...Which school do you go to?
7172|0x000C70B9|Shinigami don't go to school.
7173|0x000C70E1|Shinigami don't go to school.
7174|0x000C7118|Where are your mom and dad at?
7175|0x000C7141|Where are your mom and dad at?
7176|0x000C7179|Shinigami don't have moms and dads.
7177|0x000C71A7|Shinigami don't have moms and~dads.
7178|0x000C71DA|No matter what I asked, I was essentially getting the same reply.
7179|0x000C7226|No matter what I asked, I was~essentially getting the same~reply.
7180|0x000C7281|...Okay, then let's assume all of that is true and go on...
7181|0x000C72C7|...Okay, then let's assume all~of that is true and go on...
7182|0x000C731C|Everything I said IS true.
7183|0x000C7341|Everything I said IS true.
7184|0x000C7375|What are you doing here?
7185|0x000C7398|What are you doing here?
7186|0x000C73D5|Didn't I already tell you that?
7187|0x000C73FF|Didn't I already tell you that?
7188|0x000C742E|The corners of her mouth perked up.
7189|0x000C745C|The corners of her mouth perked~up.
7190|0x000C748F|The bewitching smile that appeared on her face didn't quite fit her~childlike looks.
7191|0x000C74EE|The bewitching smile that~appeared on her face didn't~quite fit her childlike looks.
7192|0x000C755C|I've been waiting for you.
7193|0x000C7581|I've been waiting for you.
7194|0x000C75B5|...For what purpose?
7195|0x000C75D4|...For what purpose?
7196|0x000C7602|To fulfill my promise.
7197|0x000C7623|To fulfill my promise.
7198|0x000C7653|You mean, the promise to reunite with me?
7199|0x000C7687|You mean, the promise to~reunite with me?
7200|0x000C76CA|There's more to it than that.
7201|0x000C76F2|There's more to it than that.
7202|0x000C771F|Mare said so decisively.
7203|0x000C7742|Mare said so decisively.
7204|0x000C7795|Also in order to fulfill another promise. The promise to reap your~nightmare.
7205|0x000C77ED|Also in order to fulfill~another promise. The promise to~reap your nightmare.
7206|0x000C7878|Because I am a shinigami that reaps the nightmares of humans.
7207|0x000C78C0|Because I am a shinigami that~reaps the nightmares of humans.
7208|0x000C797E|...She wants to reap your nightmare?
7209|0x000C79AD|...She wants to reap your~nightmare?
7210|0x000C79EB|Yeah, apparently.
7211|0x000C7A07|Yeah, apparently.
7212|0x000C7A42|So, what does that mean?
7213|0x000C7A65|So, what does that mean?
7214|0x000C7A8D|That's what I wanted to know, too.
7215|0x000C7ABA|That's what I wanted to know,~too.
7216|0x000C7B06|What happened after that?
7217|0x000C7B2A|What happened after that?
7218|0x000C7B5D|I had a lot more questions pop up in my mind, but she disappeared.
7219|0x000C7BAA|I had a lot more questions pop~up in my mind, but she~disappeared.
7220|0x000C7C08|She went home?
7221|0x000C7C21|She went home?
7222|0x000C7C49|Well, I suppose.
7223|0x000C7C64|Well, I suppose.
7224|0x000C7CA8|At that time, my surroundings suddenly grew darker. As soon as I~noticed that the clouds had covered the stars up, she was already gone~from my sight.
7225|0x000C7D49|At that time, my surroundings~suddenly grew darker. As soon~as I noticed that the clouds~had covered the stars up, she
7226|0x000C7DCF|She just vanished into thin air, without even a word of goodbye.
7227|0x000C7E1A|She just vanished into thin~air, without even a word of~goodbye.
7228|0x000C7E6A|Though I could also think of that as similar to the situation when the~girl from the lookout had kissed me on my forehead. Another~resemblance.
7229|0x000C7F04|Though I could also think of~that as similar to the~situation when the girl from~the lookout had kissed me on my
7230|0x000C7F84|That time when I counted to sixty with my eyes closed, only to find~she was gone when I opened them.
7231|0x000C7FF3|That time when I counted to~sixty with my eyes closed, only~to find she was gone when I~opened them.
7232|0x000C8067|Anyhow, the gist of what I am getting at is, if I leave out all that~shinigami stuff from the equation, practically every aspect about her~was strangely identical to the girl from the lookout.
7233|0x000C8132|Anyhow, the gist of what I am~getting at is, if I leave out~all that shinigami stuff from~the equation, practically every
7234|0x000C8213|So you wanted to see her again?
7235|0x000C823D|So you wanted to see her again?
7236|0x000C8276|Yeah.
7237|0x000C8286|Yeah.
7238|0x000C82B5|Even though she's a nutjob in a shinigami costume?
7239|0x000C82F2|Even though she's a nutjob in a~shinigami costume?
7240|0x000C8334|Chinami sure didn't mince her words.
7241|0x000C8363|Chinami sure didn't mince her~words.
7242|0x000C83B1|But like, for starters, that Mare girl isn't even the girl you really~wanted to see, right?
7243|0x000C8417|But like, for starters, that~Mare girl isn't even the girl~you really wanted to see,~right?
7244|0x000C848C|From a logical standpoint, yeah.
7245|0x000C84B7|From a logical standpoint,~yeah.
7246|0x000C8501|You know cheating is bad, Onii-chan! If you just absolutely gotta, you~should at the very least set your eyes on a girl that's closer to you!
7247|0x000C8599|You know cheating is bad,~Onii-chan! If you just~absolutely gotta, you should at~the very least set your eyes on
7248|0x000C8623|Well, there aren't any girls I'm particularly close with.
7249|0x000C8667|Well, there aren't any girls~I'm particularly close with.
7250|0x000C86D5|Not only am I not on your romantic radar, I'm not even registered as a~girl in your mind?!
7251|0x000C873A|Not only am I not on your~romantic radar, I'm not even~registered as a girl in your~mind?!
7252|0x000C87A4|When I checked the time on my cellphone, I noted that it was about~time to head back.
7253|0x000C8804|When I checked the time on my~cellphone, I noted that it was~about time to head back.
7254|0x000C8869|It being July, the days were longer, but the orange of the sky would~still turn to a deep blue in short order.
7255|0x000C88E2|It being July, the days were~longer, but the orange of the~sky would still turn to a deep~blue in short order.
7256|0x000C896A|Let's go home. Shino-san's probably waiting.
7257|0x000C89A1|Let's go home. Shino-san's~probably waiting.
7258|0x000C89DD|I urged on the now sullen Chinami.
7259|0x000C8A0A|I urged on the now sullen~Chinami.
7260|0x000C8A46|Sorry I made you tag along here and all.
7261|0x000C8A79|Sorry I made you tag along here~and all.
7262|0x000C8ACB|You better be! I'm absolutely starving over here!
7263|0x000C8B07|You better be! I'm absolutely~starving over here!
7264|0x000C8B48|(Pretty cheeky considering she's the one who wanted to come...)
7265|0x000C8B92|(Pretty cheeky considering~she's the one who wanted to~come...)
7266|0x000C8BFB|You think that shinigami costume girl's from this town?
7267|0x000C8C3D|You think that shinigami~costume girl's from this town?
7268|0x000C8C8E|I reckon she has to be.
7269|0x000C8CB0|I reckon she has to be.
7270|0x000C8CF1|Well then in that case, dontcha think you'll be seeing her around even~if you don't come here? With that flashy outfit, you couldn't miss her~in a crowd.
7271|0x000C8D95|Well then in that case, dontcha~think you'll be seeing her~around even if you don't come~here? With that flashy outfit,
7272|0x000C8E1C|Though she'd be taken to the nearest police station for questioning,~not to mention the stern warning they'd give her, if she were~habitually walking about in that outfit throughout the day...
7273|0x000C8EE7|Though she'd be taken to the~nearest police station for~questioning, not to mention the~stern warning they'd give her,
7274|0x000C8F6D|Actually, on second thought, she'd just get flat-out arrested for~illegal weapon possession.
7275|0x000C8FD4|Actually, on second thought,~she'd just get flat-out~arrested for illegal weapon~possession.
7276|0x000C905A|I dunno why the lookout's off limits and stuff, but are you sure you~wanna keep doing this? This could get you arrested.
7277|0x000C90DD|I dunno why the lookout's off~limits and stuff, but are you~sure you wanna keep doing this?~This could get you arrested.
7278|0x000C916F|True, I wouldn't want that. I'll try not to come too often.
7279|0x000C91B5|True, I wouldn't want that.~I'll try not to come too often.
7280|0x000C921A|...Meaning you're still gonna come here anyway. You just don't know~when to give up.
7281|0x000C9279|...Meaning you're still gonna~come here anyway. You just~don't know when to give up.
7282|0x000C9302|Something inside of me was telling me that I would only be able to see~her here.
7283|0x000C935D|Something inside of me was~telling me that I would only be~able to see her here.
7284|0x000C93BD|Was it maybe because of the fact that she was nearly identical to the~girl from the lookout?
7285|0x000C9424|Was it maybe because of the~fact that she was nearly~identical to the girl from the~lookout?
7286|0x000C9490|Or because this was a special place to both me and her?

7520|0x000CECCE|With this, her first impression of me can hardly be any better.

7538|0x000CF245|With a smile on her face, she latched onto my arm.

7548|0x000CF692|Every so often, Chinami got this look on her face like she was about~to burst into tears, but it didn't take long for her to break into a~big smile and start shoveling food into her mouth again.

7610|0x000D0CF8|Just what was giving me the idea that I'd be able to see her at~nighttime, even though I wasn't able to in the evening?

7612|0x000D0E01|The time was 8:30 at night.
7613|0x000D0E27|The time was 8:30 at night.
7614|0x000D0E52|In any normal family, a girl like her wouldn't be leaving the house~this late at night.
7615|0x000D0EB4|In any normal family, a girl~like her wouldn't be leaving~the house this late at night.
7616|0x000D0F1B|Even back when I used to play with that girl, the both of us would~usually be home before this time.

7618|0x000D0FFE|To begin with, that girl... Mare, she can't even be a teenager.

7620|0x000D1097|I had no doubt that she was quite a bit younger than me. Precisely~speaking, she seemed to be around the age the girl from the lookout~was in my memories.

7626|0x000D1358|My intent was to immediately head home once I'd confirmed with my own~two eyes that no one was there.

7630|0x000D151A|If Mare wasn't there, then that would be fine.

7655|0x000D1DDA|Huh? Wh-What?
7656|0x000D1E05|You'll get hurt real bad, and then you'll have to start living in the~hospital nearby! And, of course, when you do I'll come visit you every~day!

7662|0x000D205B|Why not?
7663|0x000D206E|Why not?
7664|0x000D2090|Well... getting injured would hurt, and the thought of it kinda scares~me.

7762|0x000D3E76|Maybe it was just by chance? After all, it's not like you can peek~inside my head and see what's going on in my mind. I'm sure that's~what it was, nothing else.

8695|0x000E72ED|...What in the world caused you~to think of this idea?
8696|0x000E7369|Because I failed at lunch earlier. I gotta get even!

8698|0x000E73F6|Did I do something that made you develop a grudge towards me or~something...?

8748|0x000E85C3|That's how I knew she would be there.
8749|0x000E85F3|That's how I knew she would be~there.
8750|0x000E8628|I could just picture her there, all alone at the desolate lookout,~looking up at the same starry sky as me.

8754|0x000E87B2|Nor did I even know who exactly she was.

8762|0x000E89CE|I'm pretty sure that 'good evening' would be more appropriate at this~time.

8770|0x000E8BBC|...That kinda hurts.
8771|0x000E8BDB|...That kinda hurts.
8772|0x000E8C1B|It's the truth.
8773|0x000E8C35|It's the truth.
8774|0x000E8C70|So, I'm sure if you added up you and me, and then divided us up by~two, we'd become the best model students in town.

8776|0x000E8D7D|They already call me a model student at school.

8826|0x000E9C97|And what are you gonna teach me?
8827|0x000E9CC2|And what are you gonna teach~me?
8828|0x000E9D0E|Stuff you don't know.
8829|0x000E9D2E|Stuff you don't know.
8830|0x000E9D5D|What kinda stuff?

8832|0x000E9DB6|You'll understand once you've become a real, genuine model student.
8833|0x000E9E04|You'll understand once you've~become a real, genuine model~student.
8834|0x000E9E57|I saw a hint of loneliness in her smile.
8835|0x000E9E8A|I saw a hint of loneliness in~her smile.
8836|0x000E9ED0|So for now, I gotta keep it a secret.
8837|0x000E9F00|So for now, I gotta keep it a~secret.
8838|0x000E9F51|I can't tell you until you've grown up a little more and become a real~model student.
8839|0x000E9FB1|I can't tell you until you've~grown up a little more and~become a real model student.
8840|0x000EA034|In retrospect, she really may have taught me something.
8841|0x000EA076|In retrospect, she really may~have taught me something.
8842|0x000EA0BD|I stood beneath the summer constellations that the two of us once~gazed up at in awe.

8844|0x000EA182|Spending time together with her was so fun that not even the passage~of time could erode those memories from within me.
8845|0x000EA204|Spending time together with her~was so fun that not even the~passage of time could erode~those memories from within me.
8846|0x000EA28B|Maybe the one thing she taught me was how much fun friends could have~together.
8847|0x000EA2E5|Maybe the one thing she taught~me was how much fun friends~could have together.
8848|0x000EA381|However, even those memories of her had become blurry in my mind from~the passage of time.
8849|0x000EA3E6|However, even those memories of~her had become blurry in my~mind from the passage of time.
8850|0x000EA450|I suppose that means I had already started to forget these precious~memories of her, even though I held them so dear.

8852|0x000EA555|That feeling, telling me that I loved to play with her, had already~started to erode somewhere inside me.
8853|0x000EA5C9|That feeling, telling me that I~loved to play with her, had~already started to erode~somewhere inside me.
8854|0x000EA642|Or maybe it had completely eroded away after so much time.

8856|0x000EA6D1|I can't call myself a model student if I forget things like this.
8857|0x000EA71D|I can't call myself a model~student if I forget things like~this.
8858|0x000EA76E|I wouldn't pass the test.
8859|0x000EA792|I wouldn't pass the test.
8860|0x000EA7BB|Even though I never failed a test in school, I would fail the test in~her class.
8861|0x000EA816|Even though I never failed a~test in school, I would fail~the test in her class.
8862|0x000EA876|Maybe I upset her because I never became a model student, despite all~her efforts to teach me.

8864|0x000EA94D|I worried that she might not show up in front of me because she was~angry.

8876|0x000EAD3C|Climbing the hill all the way to the top was hard to manage with a~kid's stamina. The fact that Chinami gave up halfway and called a taxi~to take her home is a good example of that.

8884|0x000EB121|Well, she was quite the rambunctious girl, so I suppose it may have~just been a case of her having more stamina than I did at the time.

8886|0x000EB239|After all, very much living up to the 'egghead' name she'd always~called me, I used to be a student with basically nothing else going~for me besides the fact that I got good grades at school.

8896|0x000EB622|Since it was already my fourth time, I was rather used to it by now,~so I didn't get caught in any branches, nor did I ever lose my~footing.

8907|0x000EBA6F|Those were the first words she~directed towards me.
8908|0x000EBABC|...Considering the time, you should really be saying 'good evening'.

8910|0x000EBB69|You're really fussy, you know that?
8911|0x000EBB97|You're really fussy, you know~that?
8912|0x000EBBD4|...Hm, you think so?

8918|0x000EBCF1|I sure do.
8919|0x000EBD06|I sure do.
8920|0x000EBD2A|Think about it. If you add up the two of us, then divide us up by two,~won't we become the best model students in town?
8921|0x000EBDAC|Think about it. If you add up~the two of us, then divide us~up by two, won't we become the~best model students in town?
8922|0x000EBE3D|No.
8923|0x000EBE4B|No.

8926|0x000EBE9F|Shinigami don't become model students.
8927|0x000EBED0|Shinigami don't become model~students.
8928|0x000EBF06|...Oh, right.
8929|0x000EBF1E|...Oh, right.
8930|0x000EBF45|Back when I was a kid, they used to call me a model student.
8931|0x000EBF8C|Back when I was a kid, they~used to call me a model~student.
8932|0x000EBFED|Oh, did they?
8933|0x000EC005|Oh, did they?
8934|0x000EC02C|Although, that was only because of my grades. When it came to just~about everything else, I didn't live up to the title of model student.

8940|0x000EC20C|Except for the girl from the lookout, of course.
8941|0x000EC247|Except for the girl from the~lookout, of course.
8942|0x000EC291|However, after I transferred schools, I underwent a drastic change and~began to make friends. I hung out with friends and goofed around like~anyone else. I guess that, in turn, made me stop being a model student~in a different sense.

8948|0x000EC597|Just some girl, but I think she might have liked me.
8949|0x000EC5D6|Just some girl, but I think she~might have liked me.
8950|0x000EC62F|......
8951|0x000EC640|......
8952|0x000EC660|The thing is, I never realized she felt that way about me.
8953|0x000EC6A5|The thing is, I never realized~she felt that way about me.
8954|0x000EC6F9|Huh...
8955|0x000EC70A|Huh...

8958|0x000EC817|Figures.
8959|0x000EC82A|Figures.

8961|0x000EC890|Also, I wasn't a model student~in regards to love either.
8962|0x000EC8E3|Makes sense.
8963|0x000EC8FA|Makes sense.
8964|0x000EC920|So maybe, like...
8965|0x000EC93C|So maybe, like...
8966|0x000EC95D|Maybe, because of my inadequacy, the girl from the lookout was trying~to teach me about love as well.
8967|0x000EC9CD|Maybe, because of my~inadequacy, the girl from the~lookout was trying to teach me~about love as well.
8968|0x000ECA42|Maybe that's what that first kiss on my forehead meant.
8969|0x000ECA84|Maybe that's what that first~kiss on my forehead meant.
8970|0x000ECACB|Back then, we had a relationship sort of like student and teacher.
8971|0x000ECB18|Back then, we had a~relationship sort of like~student and teacher.
8972|0x000ECB6A|I guess you could say that kind of bond connected us.
8973|0x000ECBAA|I guess you could say that kind~of bond connected us.
8974|0x000ECBEF|But then time passed and come present day, the only things  that~connected me and her were this lookout and her name.
8975|0x000ECC6F|But then time passed and come~present day, the only things ~that connected me and her were~this lookout and her name.
8976|0x000ECCF4|If I had lost either of those two, I could very well have lost any~shot of meeting her again for the rest of my life.
8977|0x000ECD74|If I had lost either of those~two, I could very well have~lost any shot of meeting her~again for the rest of my life.
8978|0x000ECDF9|I couldn't get that fear out of my chest.
8979|0x000ECE2D|I couldn't get that fear out of~my chest.
8980|0x000ECE66|And that's why I had to prevent myself from forgetting them at all~costs.
8981|0x000ECEBA|And that's why I had to prevent~myself from forgetting them at~all costs.
8982|0x000ECF13|No matter how hazy my memories eventually became.
8983|0x000ECF4F|No matter how hazy my memories~eventually became.
8984|0x000ECF90|At the very least, I absolutely had to hold on to her name.
8985|0x000ECFD6|At the very least, I absolutely~had to hold on to her name.
8986|0x000ED036|So, what? What were you gonna say?

8988|0x000ED09F|...Nevermind.
8989|0x000ED0B7|...Nevermind.
8990|0x000ED0D4|It wasn't the kind of thing that I could say out loud.
8991|0x000ED115|It wasn't the kind of thing~that I could say out loud.
8992|0x000ED15B|Despite their resemblance, the girl in front of me wasn't the girl~from back then.
8993|0x000ED1B8|Despite their resemblance, the~girl in front of me wasn't the~girl from back then.
8994|0x000ED21A|Despite all the things about her which coincided with my memories,~realistically there was just no way she could be that girl.
8995|0x000ED2A3|Despite all the things about~her which coincided with my~memories, realistically there~was just no way she could be
8996|0x000ED326|And that's exactly why I wanted to know what kind of girl Mare is.

9155|0x000EF973|...Look, you shouldn't go~around pointing that thing at~people. You'll poke someone's~eye out.
9156|0x000EF9EB|The way you talk to me like I'm some little kid is getting on my last~nerve.

10858|0x00117D7C|Mare didn't open her mouth, instead just staring at me.

10890|0x001185ED|I did as she said, and then a short period of time passed without~anything happening.

12352|0x0013A002|Right in the gut!
12353|0x0013A01E|Right in the gut!
12354|0x0013A08F|So, are you going to join the Astro Club?
12355|0x0013A0C3|So, are you going to join the~Astro Club?
12356|0x0013A116|Kosame-chan's a member, too. So if you join too that'll put us at five~members in total!

12358|0x0013A1EB|Well, about that, could I put my answer on hold?
12359|0x0013A226|Well, about that, could I put~my answer on hold?
12360|0x0013A282|Asuho and Kosame-san blinked in surprise.
12361|0x0013A2B6|Asuho and Kosame-san blinked in~surprise.
12362|0x0013A2F9|I need to go look for a part-time job after school, and besides that,~there's also some other business I need to take care of.

12364|0x0013A413|Oh yeah, I remember you said you were running low on money this~morning.
12365|0x0013A466|Oh yeah, I remember you said~you were running low on money~this morning.
12366|0x0013A4C8|Yeah. So, quick question. Does this school allow students to hold~part-time jobs?
12367|0x0013A524|Yeah. So, quick question. Does~this school allow students to~hold part-time jobs?
12368|0x0013A59F|They do if you explain to them your reason for wanting to work and get~permission from school. I mean, Asuho-san is working as well.

12370|0x0013A6D6|Except in my case, it's basically just treated like helping out at~home.
12371|0x0013A729|Except in my case, it's~basically just treated like~helping out at home.
12372|0x0013A7B7|Why do you want a job anyway?
12373|0x0013A7DF|Why do you want a job anyway?
12374|0x0013A816|I have my reasons.
12375|0x0013A833|I have my reasons.
12376|0x0013A86F|If you wanna get yourself a nice camera, stay away from the digital~ones. Still ain't nothing that beats an analogue camera when it comes~to taking photos of UFOs, ghosts, and the like.

12378|0x0013A9D1|A telescope is a million times better than that! And if you think~those are too expensive, there's also astronomy binoculars I can~recommend that're a whole lot cheaper!

12384|0x0013AD06|Asuho-san, I think any more than this will only serve to bother~Kogasaka-san.
12385|0x0013AD5E|Asuho-san, I think any more~than this will only serve to~bother Kogasaka-san.
12386|0x0013ADD5|Oh! Right...
12387|0x0013ADEC|Oh! Right...
12388|0x0013AE08|With a cheerful smile on her face, Kosame-san turned to me.

12398|0x0013B195|It was cold, but it still tasted pretty good.
12399|0x0013B1CD|It was cold, but it still~tasted pretty good.
12400|0x0013B250|As soon as the bell signaling the end of the school day came, I~crammed my textbooks and stuff into my book bag and stood up.

12403|0x0013B3FF|You-chan, are you gonna go get~permission for a part-time job~now?
12404|0x0013B45B|That's the plan. So, who exactly do I have to talk to about that?
12405|0x0013B4A7|That's the plan. So, who~exactly do I have to talk to~about that?
12406|0x0013B512|All you gotta do is talk to our homeroom teacher. Need me to show you~where the faculty room is?

12408|0x0013B5F7|Nah, I've been there a few times already.
12409|0x0013B62B|Nah, I've been there a few~times already.
12410|0x0013B67E|All right then. What kind of job are you looking for anyway?
12411|0x0013B6C5|All right then. What kind of~job are you looking for anyway?
12412|0x0013B71B|I haven't gotten to that point yet, honestly.
12413|0x0013B753|I haven't gotten to that point~yet, honestly.
12414|0x0013B7AA|Then what about our cafe? At the moment, it's just me and my dad doing~everything, so we could totally use some extra hands.
12415|0x0013B831|Then what about our cafe? At~the moment, it's just me and my~dad doing everything, so we~could totally use some extra
12416|0x0013B8D0|It's not really a maid cafe, so we're also looking for male staff.
12417|0x0013B91D|It's not really a maid cafe, so~we're also looking for male~staff.
12418|0x0013B979|Hmm, yeah, I'll think about it.
12419|0x0013B9A3|Hmm, yeah, I'll think about it.
12420|0x0013B9EC|Okay. I'll be waiting for your answer on that, too.
12421|0x0013BA2A|Okay. I'll be waiting for your~answer on that, too.
12422|0x0013BA76|We briefly waved at each other, and then I headed towards the hallway.
12423|0x0013BAC7|We briefly waved at each other,~and then I headed towards the~hallway.
12424|0x0013BB3A|By the way, the Occult Club is looking for male staff, too.
12425|0x0013BB80|By the way, the Occult Club is~looking for male staff, too.
12426|0x0013BBD5|...I feel like I won't be paid in a currency valid on this planet, so~I'll pass on that offer.

12428|0x0013BCE2|I received permission to get a job fairly easily.
12429|0x0013BD1E|I received permission to get a~job fairly easily.
12430|0x0013BD5F|Since my homeroom teacher was aware of my family situation, he~immediately agreed, especially since I said that it was to cover~living expenses.

12432|0x0013BE7C|I was thankful for his blessing.
12433|0x0013BEA7|I was thankful for his~blessing.
12434|0x0013BED7|However, when he encouraged me and told me that I'd be fine so long as~I kept working hard, that makes me feel kinda awkward. Or rather, it~irritated me because it struck me as meddling in my business.

12438|0x0013C0F7|With that out of the way, next I went up to the fourth floor where the~third-year classrooms are.

12440|0x0013C1D4|There were three items on the list of things I needed to take care of~here before I went home.

12444|0x0013C348|Since I had already completed that, I then moved on to the second~item, which is what brought me to this floor.

12446|0x0013C441|Asking around for information was the first step in searching for the~girl from the lookout whose name I'd lost.

12448|0x0013C561|I scanned the faces of the third-years as I passed by them in the~hallway.
12449|0x0013C5B6|I scanned the faces of the~third-years as I passed by them~in the hallway.
12450|0x0013C610|I peeked into the individual classrooms, looking at the faces of all~the girls currently enjoying the freedom felt by every student at the~end of the school day.

12456|0x0013C847|Inside my memories, she was obviously still a child, but even if she~had matured and changed since then, common facial features would~remain.

12462|0x0013CAEA|The girl from the lookout was from Hibarigasaki. Since we used to play~together at the lookout, that's a fact I was quite certain of.

12476|0x0013D155|A considerable amount of questioning gazes were directed at me.
12477|0x0013D19F|A considerable amount of~questioning gazes were directed~at me.
12478|0x0013D1EE|That's only natural considering a student they'd never seen before was~wandering around and even going as far as to suspiciously peek into~classrooms, only to leave again right away.

12482|0x0013D409|Yet, I couldn't spot her anywhere.
12483|0x0013D436|Yet, I couldn't spot her~anywhere.
12484|0x0013D468|I'd gone and checked all third-year classrooms, but in the end, there~were no students that resembled her.

12678|0x00141695|According to Nee-san, the grade you managed to achieve during your~transfer examination was so excellent, that if you continue to perform~like that, you could very well be chosen as the representative for our~grade level.

13843|0x0015C54D|All you know about anything is~a little bit, according to you.
13844|0x0015C5B5|Was it one of your formative experiences? Like, did you go to a~planetarium show in your childhood and then that made you wanna know~more?

13925|0x0015E43F|That girl attended the same~elementary school as us, right?~Does that mean she was our~upperclassman?

13937|0x0015E80B|Hey, if that girl loves stars~and she goes here, do you think~she would join the Astro Club?
13938|0x0015E891|Since she was your upperclassman, that means there's a chance she's a~third-year here, right?

13940|0x0015E9A5|I concur. If she is indeed a third-year here, there is only one year~left until her graduation, but I think it would be worth recruiting~her in order to get closer to becoming a real club all the same.

13974|0x0015F49F|I was wondering about that girl I told you I played with all the time,~the girl from the lookout. I did forget her name, but there's no~mistaking that she used to live around these parts.

14064|0x00161135|I kinda want a new camera, so maybe I should get a job too.

14516|0x0016A35E|Oh, well, um...
14517|0x0016A378|Oh, well, um...
14518|0x0016A397|It seemed unusual for Asuho to be so nervous.
14519|0x0016A3CF|It seemed unusual for Asuho to~be so nervous.
14520|0x0016A40C|...Well, it's not like I would know what's normal for Asuho. I hadn't~known her for that long, so perhaps I just didn't know about that side~of her.
14521|0x0016A4AB|...Well, it's not like I would~know what's normal for Asuho. I~hadn't known her for that long,~so perhaps I just didn't know
14522|0x0016A557|Well... uh, umm...
14523|0x0016A574|Well... uh, umm...
14524|0x0016A5A2|Y-You see, like, I...
14525|0x0016A5C2|Y-You see, like, I...
14526|0x0016A5E7|Asuho gazed at me with upturned eyes.
14527|0x0016A617|Asuho gazed at me with upturned~eyes.
14528|0x0016A666|Actually, when it comes to you, I think I might...
14529|0x0016A6A3|Actually, when it comes to you,~I think I might...
14530|0x0016A6EF|......
14531|0x0016A700|......
14532|0x0016A716|(...Wait, is she actually confessing her feelings?)
14533|0x0016A754|(...Wait, is she actually~confessing her feelings?)
14534|0x0016A797|(No way. That's impossible.)
14535|0x0016A7BE|(No way. That's impossible.)
14536|0x0016A7F6|Y-You-chan, I...
14537|0x0016A811|Y-You-chan, I...
14538|0x0016A831|(There's no way...)
14539|0x0016A84F|(There's no way...)
14540|0x0016A88C|I feel like I can understand you... I kind of understand why you want~to see the girl from the lookout again.
14541|0x0016A904|I feel like I can understand~you... I kind of understand why~you want to see the girl from~the lookout again.
14542|0x0016A981|(...There we go. Of course it wasn't a confession.)
14543|0x0016A9BF|(...There we go. Of course it~wasn't a confession.)
14544|0x0016AA1C|So I gave it some serious thought.
14545|0x0016AA49|So I gave it some serious~thought.
14546|0x0016AA7B|An embarrassed smile appeared on her lips.
14547|0x0016AAB0|An embarrassed smile appeared~on her lips.
14548|0x0016AB21|Do you want to come with me and visit our old elementary school?
14549|0x0016AB6C|Do you want to come with me and~visit our old elementary~school?
14550|0x0016ABBC|That's what she ended up asking.
14551|0x0016ABE7|That's what she ended up~asking.
14552|0x0016AC31|I heard about it from Kosame-chan during break. You haven't found the~girl from the lookout yet, right?
14553|0x0016ACA3|I heard about it from~Kosame-chan during break. You~haven't found the girl from the~lookout yet, right?
14554|0x0016AD26|You haven't been able to see her yet, even though you really want to,~right?
14555|0x0016AD7D|You haven't been able to see~her yet, even though you really~want to, right?
14556|0x0016ADE5|You... must really want to see her face again, right?
14557|0x0016AE25|You... must really want to see~her face again, right?
14558|0x0016AE84|So, that's why I was thinking...
14559|0x0016AEAF|So, that's why I was~thinking...
14560|0x0016AEE9|...I see.
14561|0x0016AEFD|...I see.
14562|0x0016AF16|I finally understood where she was going with all of this.
14563|0x0016AF5B|I finally understood where she~was going with all of this.
14564|0x0016AFDF|Yep. If we try our elementary yearbooks, we should be able to find her~in one, dont you think?
14565|0x0016B048|Yep. If we try our elementary~yearbooks, we should be able to~find her in one, dont you~think?
14566|0x0016B0D5|The lookout girl indeed used to attend our grade school.
14567|0x0016B118|The lookout girl indeed used to~attend our grade school.
14568|0x0016B160|I don't know which grade she was in, though. All I know is that she~must have been older than me.
14569|0x0016B1CC|I don't know which grade she~was in, though. All I know is~that she must have been older~than me.
14570|0x0016B23D|However, it should be almost safe to assume our elementary has all of~their yearbooks on collection, just like Hibari High.
14571|0x0016B2C3|However, it should be almost~safe to assume our elementary~has all of their yearbooks on~collection, just like Hibari
14572|0x0016B348|So I could obtain her contact information by searching through those~yearbooks.
14573|0x0016B3A2|So I could obtain her contact~information by searching~through those yearbooks.
14574|0x0016B401|If it had been just me, things might have been difficult.
14575|0x0016B445|If it had been just me, things~might have been difficult.
14576|0x0016B48E|I didn't graduate from that grade school, as things were. Not being a~graduate, the prospects of me getting permission to inspect the~yearbooks were rather unpromising.
14577|0x0016B541|I didn't graduate from that~grade school, as things were.~Not being a graduate, the~prospects of me getting
14578|0x0016B5BC|Asuho, on the other hand, is a graduate.
14579|0x0016B5EF|Asuho, on the other hand, is a~graduate.
14580|0x0016B627|I really have to thank her for going out of her way to help me like~this.
14581|0x0016B67B|I really have to thank her for~going out of her way to help me~like this.
14582|0x0016B6DA|Thus, we headed toward the grade school together.
14583|0x0016B716|Thus, we headed toward the~grade school together.
14584|0x0016B783|Thing is, I don't have a single yearbook from our elementary school.
14585|0x0016B7D2|Thing is, I don't have a single~yearbook from our elementary~school.
14586|0x0016B855|Yeah, that's what I figured. You transferred out.
14587|0x0016B891|Yeah, that's what I figured.~You transferred out.
14588|0x0016B8D2|Asuho walked by my side.
14589|0x0016B8F5|Asuho walked by my side.
14590|0x0016B91D|The distance between us seemed just about the same as the distance~between our desks in the classroom.
14591|0x0016B98E|The distance between us seemed~just about the same as the~distance between our desks in~the classroom.
14592|0x0016BA04|She was on my right side too, just like in class.
14593|0x0016BA40|She was on my right side too,~just like in class.
14594|0x0016BA8B|You have a yearbook though, right?
14595|0x0016BAB8|You have a yearbook though,~right?
14596|0x0016BB04|Yep, sure do. Want me to show you some time?
14597|0x0016BB3B|Yep, sure do. Want me to show~you some time?
14598|0x0016BB81|Nah, that's fine.
14599|0x0016BB9D|Nah, that's fine.
14600|0x0016BBD8|Oh, are you sure?
14601|0x0016BBF4|Oh, are you sure?
14602|0x0016BC1F|Yeah.
14603|0x0016BC2F|Yeah.
14604|0x0016BC5E|You might remember some of our classmates if you see it.
14605|0x0016BCA1|You might remember some of our~classmates if you see it.
14606|0x0016BD03|That might help you remember their names, too.
14607|0x0016BD3C|That might help you remember~their names, too.
14608|0x0016BD94|Possibly even the lookout girl's...
14609|0x0016BDC2|Possibly even the lookout~girl's...
14610|0x0016BDF5|She sounded a bit melancholy when she said the last part.
14611|0x0016BE39|She sounded a bit melancholy~when she said the last part.
14612|0x0016BEB2|If you go down Yumemi Hill, then continue going straight ahead, the~roundabout in front of the station eventually comes into sight.

14616|0x0016C0A3|Only vaguely.
14617|0x0016C0BB|Only vaguely.
14618|0x0016C0F2|It's this way. Let's go!
14619|0x0016C115|It's this way. Let's go!
14620|0x0016C150|I'm pretty sure there was a railroad crossing by the station if you~turned right here.
14621|0x0016C1B1|I'm pretty sure there was a~railroad crossing by the~station if you turned right~here.
14622|0x0016C217|Asuho turned right, just like my memories told me to.
14623|0x0016C257|Asuho turned right, just like~my memories told me to.
14624|0x0016C2C8|The railway separates Hibarigasaki's seaward side where the elementary~school is located from the mountain side where Hibari High is located.~The latter is very hilly, while the former is relatively flat and~level.

14626|0x0016C428|Leaving the chic shopping district behind me, I followed the alluring~sea breeze to our destination.
14627|0x0016C497|Leaving the chic shopping~district behind me, I followed~the alluring sea breeze to our~destination.
14628|0x0016C50B|While my memories were hazy, my body still remembered the way.
14629|0x0016C554|While my memories were hazy, my~body still remembered the way.
14630|0x0016C5A2|Or maybe it was thanks to Asuho leading the way.
14631|0x0016C5DD|Or maybe it was thanks to Asuho~leading the way.
14632|0x0016C623|Either way, I could literally feel through my feet that we were~getting closer to our grade school.
14633|0x0016C691|Either way, I could literally~feel through my feet that we~were getting closer to our~grade school.
14634|0x0016C738|Finally, our destination came into sight.
14635|0x0016C76C|Finally, our destination came~into sight.
14636|0x0016C7DA|Mhmm, that's our elementary school all right. Hasn't changed one bit.
14637|0x0016C82A|Mhmm, that's our elementary~school all right. Hasn't~changed one bit.
14638|0x0016C889|It's been a while since you've been here, too?
14639|0x0016C8C2|It's been a while since you've~been here, too?
14640|0x0016C91A|Not as long as you, but yeah. There's not much reason to come here~once you've graduated, you know.
14641|0x0016C988|Not as long as you, but yeah.~There's not much reason to come~here once you've graduated, you~know.
14642|0x0016CA15|It'd actually be pretty cool to do a class reunion eventually, if you~ask me!
14643|0x0016CA6D|It'd actually be pretty cool to~do a class reunion eventually,~if you ask me!
14644|0x0016CAD4|You think?

14646|0x0016CB28|Yep.
14647|0x0016CB37|Yep.
14648|0x0016CB65|Of course, I'll invite you, too, when that time comes.

14650|0x0016CBF6|Nah, you don't have to.

14656|0x0016CD91|So, You-chan, how's it feel being back here after so long?
14657|0x0016CDD6|So, You-chan, how's it feel~being back here after so long?
14658|0x0016CE2A|It's kind of nostalgic, but maybe not that much.
14659|0x0016CE65|It's kind of nostalgic, but~maybe not that much.
14660|0x0016CEBF|Make up your mind, geez.
14661|0x0016CEE2|Make up your mind, geez.
14662|0x0016CF14|You see, I actually don't remember all that much about it.
14663|0x0016CF59|You see, I actually don't~remember all that much about~it.
14664|0x0016CFA3|If I had to describe it, I'd say it's like my body remembers, but my~mind isn't quite able to keep up.

14666|0x0016D094|If someone told me I went to elementary school there, I wouldn't~disagree with them, but at the same time, if someone told me this~school wasn't it, I'd probably believe them too.

14670|0x0016D264|What makes you think that?
14671|0x0016D289|What makes you think that?
14672|0x0016D2CD|Well, I thought that maybe you don't wanna remember it because you~don't have any good memories of it.
14673|0x0016D33E|Well, I thought that maybe you~don't wanna remember it because~you don't have any good~memories of it.
14674|0x0016D3BE|No, it's nothing like that. I didn't have anything against coming to~school and going to class.
14675|0x0016D428|No, it's nothing like that. I~didn't have anything against~coming to school and going to~class.
14676|0x0016D4B1|Did you hate our class?

14680|0x0016D591|So back then...

14682|0x0016D5CA|There was a hint of sadness in her voice.

14684|0x0016D651|You didn't have much interest in school, huh?

14686|0x0016D6C6|I didn't hate school or anything.
14687|0x0016D6F2|I didn't hate school or~anything.
14688|0x0016D723|However, it was the kind of thing where if you asked me instead if I~liked it, I wouldn't be able to say yes.

14718|0x0016DEBA|I couldn't help wondering about her.

14720|0x0016DF1D|She wasn't dressed appropriately for walking around town.

14736|0x0016E294|...Nothing.
14737|0x0016E2AA|...Nothing.

14766|0x0016EAB5|Thanks for everything today.
14767|0x0016EADC|Thanks for everything today.
14768|0x0016EB39|Nah... You don't have to thank me...
14769|0x0016EB68|Nah... You don't have to thank~me...
14770|0x0016EBA6|You live in the shopping district, right? Guess that means we'll have~to say goodbye here.

14774|0x0016ECC0|See you at school tomorrow, Asuho.

14776|0x0016ED1F|The moment I turned to leave, Asuho started speaking again.
14777|0x0016ED65|The moment I turned to leave,~Asuho started speaking again.
14778|0x0016EDCA|Sorry...
14779|0x0016EDDD|Sorry...
14780|0x0016EDFB|My body went limp.
14781|0x0016EE18|My body went limp.
14782|0x0016EE58|...Why are you apologizing to me?
14783|0x0016EE84|...Why are you apologizing to~me?
14784|0x0016EECF|......
14785|0x0016EEE0|......
14786|0x0016EF00|Look, it's no big deal. I mean it.
14787|0x0016EF2D|Look, it's no big deal. I mean~it.
14788|0x0016EF5F|Asuho was nothing but helpful all day.
14789|0x0016EF90|Asuho was nothing but helpful~all day.
14790|0x0016EFC6|But that expression of hers really pained me to look at.
14791|0x0016F009|But that expression of hers~really pained me to look at.
14792|0x0016F051|The last thing I wanted was for her somber mood to spread to me.
14793|0x0016F09C|The last thing I wanted was for~her somber mood to spread to~me.
14794|0x0016F0EC|Despite my past self telling me that I couldn't give up on the search~without living the rest of my life in regret, another part of me was~losing its resolve.

14796|0x0016F220|I was starting to think that maybe it was too late.
14797|0x0016F25E|I was starting to think that~maybe it was too late.
14798|0x0016F2A1|The girl from the lookout wasn't in any of the grade school yearbooks.
14799|0x0016F2F2|The girl from the lookout~wasn't in any of the grade~school yearbooks.
14800|0x0016F367|The clerk guided us to the library and showed us the yearbooks.
14801|0x0016F3B1|The clerk guided us to the~library and showed us the~yearbooks.
14802|0x0016F400|Even though she was older than me, it was possible to limit the search~to fewer than ten yearbooks, so it didn't take that long to look~through them.
14803|0x0016F4A0|Even though she was older than~me, it was possible to limit~the search to fewer than ten~yearbooks, so it didn't take
14804|0x0016F525|I can confidently say that I went through each and every one of them~and checked them thoroughly.
14805|0x0016F591|I can confidently say that I~went through each and every one~of them and checked them~thoroughly.
14806|0x0016F602|Yet I wasn't able to find any girl that could have been her.
14807|0x0016F649|Yet I wasn't able to find any~girl that could have been her.
14808|0x0016F695|Naturally, that dismayed and confused me.
14809|0x0016F6C9|Naturally, that dismayed and~confused me.
14810|0x0016F702|In Hibarigasaki, elementary schools operate under a district system.~It isn't like Hibari High where you have the choice to enroll or not.~As long as you live in that school's district, you'll be enrolled~there, without exception.

14812|0x0016F874|And just like me, she traveled to the lookout on foot.
14813|0x0016F8B5|And just like me, she traveled~to the lookout on foot.
14814|0x0016F8FB|If you also take the slopes of Yumemi Hill into account, it would be~downright unimaginable for a kid to get there by foot if they didn't~live nearby.

14816|0x0016FA26|So she must have been living in my neighborhood.
14817|0x0016FA61|So she must have been living in~my neighborhood.
14818|0x0016FAA1|Taking that into account, there's no doubt in my mind that she~attended that elementary school.

14820|0x0016FB7A|Yet, despite all of that, there was no trace of her in any of the~yearbooks...
14821|0x0016FBD3|Yet, despite all of that, there~was no trace of her in any of~the yearbooks...
14822|0x0016FC31|Why?
14823|0x0016FC40|Why?
14824|0x0016FC54|There was only one explanation that made sense at this point.
14825|0x0016FC9C|There was only one explanation~that made sense at this point.
14826|0x0016FCE9|Namely, that she'd transferred away, just like I did.
14827|0x0016FD29|Namely, that she'd transferred~away, just like I did.
14828|0x0016FD6E|Because she moved away before her graduation, she never made it into~any yearbook.
14829|0x0016FDCB|Because she moved away before~her graduation, she never made~it into any yearbook.
14830|0x0016FE2D|Which means...
14831|0x0016FE46|Which means...
14832|0x0016FE82|The chances of me seeing her now, taking that into account, are slim~to none.
14833|0x0016FEDA|The chances of me seeing her~now, taking that into account,~are slim to none.
14834|0x0016FF37|Even if I knew her name, that wouldn't change anything.
14835|0x0016FF79|Even if I knew her name, that~wouldn't change anything.
14836|0x0016FFC0|If you have no sort of contact information regarding a person, it's~essentially impossible to trace their whereabouts. They could be~living literally anywhere in the world, for all you know.

14840|0x00170149|All the strength left my body.
14841|0x00170172|All the strength left my body.
14842|0x001701A0|Upon hitting that realization, the sole strand of tension I'd~preserved after parting with Asuho crumbled to nothingness.

14846|0x00170328|Trekking down the steep, orange-dyed slope of Yumemi Hill, felt like~nothing but a chore to me now.

14864|0x001707C6|I see.

14866|0x00170806|Setsuna-senpai threw a sidelong glance past the fence.
14867|0x00170847|Setsuna-senpai threw a sidelong~glance past the fence.
14868|0x001708A7|By any chance, have you been going to the lookout because you're~waiting for her?
14869|0x00170903|By any chance, have you been~going to the lookout because~you're waiting for her?
14870|0x00170964|I couldn't even muster the energy to answer.

14876|0x00170AE1|I entered the woods that ran alongside the road.

14884|0x00170DD8|I should have been fully aware of that by this point.
14885|0x00170E18|I should have been fully aware~of that by this point.
