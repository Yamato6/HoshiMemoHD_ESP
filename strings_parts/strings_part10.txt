85369|0x0069735B|I'll give you plenty, so go and~enjoy them with your whole~family.
85370|0x006973B7|Huh. So you made more than only enough for those that were supposed to~come.
85371|0x0069740E|Huh. So you made more than only~enough for those that were~supposed to come.
85372|0x00697484|Yeah. I wanted to make enough for everyone, but it was a bit hard~since I didn't know how much everyone would want.
85373|0x00697502|Yeah. I wanted to make enough~for everyone, but it was a bit~hard since I didn't know how~much everyone would want.
85374|0x0069759F|So I figured eh, why not just go ahead and make as much as I could.
85375|0x006975ED|So I figured eh, why not just~go ahead and make as much as I~could.
85376|0x0069767E|...How many did you make?
85377|0x006976A2|...How many did you make?
85378|0x006976E5|I went with ten per person.
85379|0x0069770B|I went with ten per person.
85380|0x00697775|...Are you trying to make me fat or what?

85387|0x006979A5|Asuho-kun, let's get started~for real this time then.
85388|0x00697A2C|Right. Now then, everyone, today we'll be focusing on the full moon~with our observations.
85389|0x00697A91|Right. Now then, everyone,~today we'll be focusing on the~full moon with our~observations.
85390|0x00697AFB|Asuho adjusted the focus of the telescope, then stepped away to let us~use it.
85391|0x00697B54|Asuho adjusted the focus of the~telescope, then stepped away to~let us use it.
85392|0x00697BD7|There are countless craters visible on the moon's surface.

85394|0x00697C66|It's assumed that these resulted from meteor impacts.
85395|0x00697CA6|It's assumed that these~resulted from meteor impacts.
85396|0x00697CFD|Smaller meteorites that come down as shooting stars certainly have a~charming aspect to them, but they aren't always that small.

85398|0x00697E11|Yeah. Take the Barringer Crater in Arizona, for example. It resulted~from a meteor that came down tens of thousands of years ago and has a~1.2 kilometer diameter with a whopping 180 meter depth. If one like~that hit a city, that'd be a disaster.

85402|0x0069805C|Strangely enough, Aoi-san was using Asuho's telescope tonight.

85404|0x006980FD|Did you not bring your telescope, Aoi-san?
85405|0x00698132|Did you not bring your~telescope, Aoi-san?
85406|0x00698186|...No, not today. I thought I wouldn't be needing it since today's~main entree is the moon-viewing dumplings.

85411|0x00698359|We're also celebrating us~reaching club status too.

85416|0x0069852E|When you look at the full moon through a telescope it's really clear~and vivid, but it's still pretty difficult to make out the craters.

85422|0x00698840|Well, the thing is, it's also hard to see the other stars when you~have a full moon.

85908|0x006A0E41|This sure doesn't sound like the sadist girl I know.
85909|0x006A0E80|This sure doesn't sound like~the sadist girl I know.
85910|0x006A0ED0|It's only because your sadism outweighs mine...
85911|0x006A0F0A|It's only because your sadism~outweighs mine...
85912|0x006A0F53|I don't think that's it either.

85978|0x006A1E65|Thank you very much for asking me out on a date.
85979|0x006A1EA0|Thank you very much for asking~me out on a date.
85980|0x006A1EEA|That isn't really an exemplary reply as a girlfriend.
85981|0x006A1F2A|That isn't really an exemplary~reply as a girlfriend.
85982|0x006A1F89|Then what would be a better answer?
85983|0x006A1FB7|Then what would be a better~answer?
85984|0x006A1FF4|I figured I'd be nice and go on this date with you, so show some~gratitude. Something like that.

86002|0x006A2601|No, no, not at all.

86005|0x006A268D|The hickey you gave me is still~there.
86006|0x006A26C3|After saying that, she held up her hair and showed me her neck.
86007|0x006A270D|After saying that, she held up~her hair and showed me her~neck.
86008|0x006A2776|This is proof of you having teased me.
86009|0x006A27A7|This is proof of you having~teased me.
86010|0x006A27E7|...I don't think that counts as teasing.
86011|0x006A281A|...I don't think that counts as~teasing.

86022|0x006A2ACD|I could only keep my mouth shut after hearing that.
86023|0x006A2B0B|I could only keep my mouth shut~after hearing that.
86024|0x006A2B68|The pain when I got that burn was gone right away, but the pain from~last night isn't going away...
86025|0x006A2BD6|The pain when I got that burn~was gone right away, but the~pain from last night isn't~going away...

86042|0x006A3040|A boyfriend should instead help me walk...

86044|0x006A30B5|She snuggled up to me and softly intertwined her arm with mine.
86045|0x006A30FF|She snuggled up to me and~softly intertwined her arm with~mine.
86046|0x006A315A|This is how we ought to enjoy our date.
86047|0x006A318C|This is how we ought to enjoy~our date.
86048|0x006A31C3|She said so with a shy smile on her face.
86049|0x006A31F7|She said so with a shy smile on~her face.
86050|0x006A3273|What should we start off with?

86055|0x006A3385|And I'm fine with going~anywhere you want to.
86056|0x006A33CE|Well, we'll never decide where to go if neither of us has any~preferences.
86057|0x006A3423|Well, we'll never decide where~to go if neither of us has any~preferences.
86058|0x006A347D|It was just like last time, when we were strolling through the~shopping district after we'd left Asuho's cafe.
86059|0x006A34F6|It was just like last time,~when we were strolling through~the shopping district after~we'd left Asuho's cafe.
86060|0x006A357E|Wanna swing by the Milky Way then? You'd be able to rest there.
86061|0x006A35C8|Wanna swing by the Milky Way~then? You'd be able to rest~there.
86062|0x006A3630|...That's fine. I'm perfectly fine walking around like this.
86063|0x006A3677|...That's fine. I'm perfectly~fine walking around like this.
86064|0x006A36CF|Besides, I'd have to work up a lot of courage before letting Asuho-san~see us like this.
86065|0x006A3732|Besides, I'd have to work up a~lot of courage before letting~Asuho-san see us like this.
86066|0x006A379A|So I guess Kosame-san was also conscious of the fact that we weren't~playing pretend anymore.
86067|0x006A3802|So I guess Kosame-san was also~conscious of the fact that we~weren't playing pretend~anymore.
86068|0x006A387B|It's not like I want to hide it... Precisely because she's a close~friend, I won't hide it from her.
86069|0x006A38EA|It's not like I want to hide~it... Precisely because she's a~close friend, I won't hide it~from her.
86070|0x006A3977|But the thing is, I'm just not quite sure how I should act around her~now.
86071|0x006A39CC|But the thing is, I'm just not~quite sure how I should act~around her now.
86072|0x006A3A32|If Asuho-san were to feel sad, that would make me feel sad in turn as~well...
86073|0x006A3A8A|If Asuho-san were to feel sad,~that would make me feel sad in~turn as well...

86075|0x006A3B5B|If Asuho-san were to smile,~well, I honestly don't think~that'd make me feel any~different...
86076|0x006A3BC8|I didn't know how to go about this either.

86078|0x006A3C37|There just wasn't a simple answer to it.
86079|0x006A3C6A|There just wasn't a simple~answer to it.
86080|0x006A3CBB|And what I'm fearing the most is Asuho-san teasing me about it.
86081|0x006A3D05|And what I'm fearing the most~is Asuho-san teasing me about~it.
86082|0x006A3D60|I don't think I'd be able to come back at her at all in that case.
86083|0x006A3DAD|I don't think I'd be able to~come back at her at all in that~case.

86085|0x006A3E6D|I think I'd just have to resign~myself to being teased by her~as much as she pleases...
86086|0x006A3EE0|That's the most saddening part of it.
86087|0x006A3F10|That's the most saddening part~of it.
86088|0x006A3F4F|In conclusion, you are a sadist.
86089|0x006A3F7A|In conclusion, you are a~sadist.
86090|0x006A3FC3|Hardly as much of one as you are.
86091|0x006A3FEF|Hardly as much of one as you~are.
86092|0x006A4020|Once we had to go back to school, we wouldn't be able to hide it even~if we wanted to. Kosame-san also understood that.

86096|0x006A41D0|Shall we go on where we left off last time?

86098|0x006A4279|...What do you mean?
86099|0x006A4298|...What do you mean?
86100|0x006A42C6|Well, our last date ended at the waterway, so let's use that as our~starting point for today's date.
86101|0x006A4335|Well, our last date ended at~the waterway, so let's use that~as our starting point for~today's date.

87111|0x006B60A2|Since Kogasaka-san said he~loved me, I no longer have a~need to lie to myself.
87112|0x006B610C|I'm not lying to myself anymore. Now I'm truly convinced that I should~return.
87113|0x006B6165|I'm not lying to myself~anymore. Now I'm truly~convinced that I should return.
87114|0x006B61DB|You actually want to return?
87115|0x006B6202|You actually want to return?
87116|0x006B623A|Exactly.
87117|0x006B624D|Exactly.
87118|0x006B627D|Why?
87119|0x006B628C|Why?
87120|0x006B62C0|Because I love Kogasaka-san.
87121|0x006B62E7|Because I love Kogasaka-san.
87122|0x006B632B|...How does that make any sense?
87123|0x006B6356|...How does that make any~sense?
87124|0x006B63A0|If you ever fall in love one day, I'm sure you'll understand.
87125|0x006B63E8|If you ever fall in love one~day, I'm sure you'll~understand.
87126|0x006B648E|The more my feelings for him intensify, the more I tell myself it's~wrong for me to do so...
87127|0x006B64F5|The more my feelings for him~intensify, the more I tell~myself it's wrong for me to do~so...
87128|0x006B656D|The more he tells me it's okay for me to stay here with him, the more~I think I'm wrong to do that...
87129|0x006B65DD|The more he tells me it's okay~for me to stay here with him,~the more I think I'm wrong to~do that...
87130|0x006B665E|The stronger my desire to stay here with him grows, the more I know~that I must return.
87131|0x006B66C0|The stronger my desire to stay~here with him grows, the more I~know that I must return.
87132|0x006B6741|It's strange, yes, I know. It contradicts itself.
87133|0x006B677D|It's strange, yes, I know. It~contradicts itself.
87134|0x006B67CA|I believe it's only normal that you wouldn't understand.
87135|0x006B680D|I believe it's only normal that~you wouldn't understand.
87136|0x006B6895|......
87137|0x006B68A6|......
87138|0x006B68C8|When you're in love with someone, you get strange thoughts like~this...
87139|0x006B691A|When you're in love with~someone, you get strange~thoughts like this...
87140|0x006B6989|...Nothing's strange about it.
87141|0x006B69B2|...Nothing's strange about it.
87142|0x006B69FA|Really now?
87143|0x006B6A10|Really now?
87144|0x006B6A43|Yes.
87145|0x006B6A52|Yes.
87146|0x006B6A72|Why do you say that?
87147|0x006B6A91|Why do you say that?
87148|0x006B6ACD|You said you wouldn't be lying to yourself.
87149|0x006B6B03|You said you wouldn't be lying~to yourself.
87150|0x006B6B7E|But that doesn't really mean you've gotten stronger.
87151|0x006B6BBD|But that doesn't really mean~you've gotten stronger.
87152|0x006B6C19|You just let yourself get weaker.
87153|0x006B6C45|You just let yourself get~weaker.
87154|0x006B6C80|Weaker than before.
87155|0x006B6C9E|Weaker than before.
87156|0x006B6CD9|You lost all the self-confidence you had.
87157|0x006B6D0D|You lost all the~self-confidence you had.
87158|0x006B6D50|You just don't have the confidence that you can make You-kun happy.
87159|0x006B6D9E|You just don't have the~confidence that you can make~You-kun happy.
87160|0x006B6E09|You don't want to return to the stars for someone else's sake. It's~all to satisfy yourself.
87161|0x006B6E70|You don't want to return to the~stars for someone else's sake.~It's all to satisfy yourself.
87162|0x006B6EF4|To satisfy that desire you have to run away from love.
87163|0x006B6F35|To satisfy that desire you have~to run away from love.
87164|0x006B6FC0|......

87168|0x006B7062|...No, it's Kosame.
87169|0x006B7080|...No, it's Kosame.
87170|0x006B70BB|Why are you gonna go and return just because you lack confidence in~yourself?
87171|0x006B7113|Why are you gonna go and return~just because you lack~confidence in yourself?
87172|0x006B717A|You were given the gift of life, and now you're just gonna throw it~away.
87173|0x006B71CE|You were given the gift of~life, and now you're just gonna~throw it away.
87174|0x006B7241|...Huh?
87175|0x006B7253|...Huh?
87176|0x006B7282|I don't know about any of this Astral Deity, Astral Spirit business or~whatever, but you've been born into this world. Why are you so eager~to go out of your way to leave it and return?
87177|0x006B7346|I don't know about any of this~Astral Deity, Astral Spirit~business or whatever, but~you've been born into this
87178|0x006B73D1|I... was born?

87180|0x006B7414|Rather than having died...
87181|0x006B7439|Rather than having died...
87182|0x006B747B|Well I don't know what you are, but you're alive right now.
87183|0x006B74C1|Well I don't know what you are,~but you're alive right now.
87184|0x006B7524|That's why you were able to attack me. That's how you hurt You-kun.
87185|0x006B7572|That's why you were able to~attack me. That's how you hurt~You-kun.
87186|0x006B75EB|Had you been dead, I wouldn't have come to hate you.
87187|0x006B762A|Had you been dead, I wouldn't~have come to hate you.
87188|0x006B7678|You never would have fallen in love with You-kun...
87189|0x006B76B6|You never would have fallen in~love with You-kun...
87190|0x006B7711|Neither would he with you.
87191|0x006B7736|Neither would he with you.
87192|0x006B777A|......
87193|0x006B778B|......
87194|0x006B77B9|...Now I'm all mad from saying that.
87195|0x006B77E8|...Now I'm all mad from saying~that.
87196|0x006B7836|And I love you for that.
87197|0x006B7859|And I love you for that.
87198|0x006B7899|...Blockhead.
87199|0x006B78B1|...Blockhead.
87200|0x006B78E6|You're a blockhead, and those tears don't change it.
87201|0x006B7925|You're a blockhead, and those~tears don't change it.
87202|0x006B7975|...There are no tears on my face.
87203|0x006B79A1|...There are no tears on my~face.
87204|0x006B79EA|Yeah, whatever.
87205|0x006B7A04|Yeah, whatever.
87206|0x006B7A3B|But since you're purposefully gonna make You-kun grieve, I can't think~of you as anything but a big, stupid blockhead.
87207|0x006B7ABC|But since you're purposefully~gonna make You-kun grieve, I~can't think of you as anything~but a big, stupid blockhead.
87208|0x006B7B5C|......
87209|0x006B7B6D|......
87210|0x006B7B9D|Would he... grieve if I were to disappear...?
87211|0x006B7BD5|Would he... grieve if I were to~disappear...?
87212|0x006B7C2A|The fact that you have to think about that proves there's something~wrong with you.
87213|0x006B7C88|The fact that you have to think~about that proves there's~something wrong with you.
87214|0x006B7D05|...And I have to blame that on love too.
87215|0x006B7D38|...And I have to blame that on~love too.
87216|0x006B7D7C|Because this love is simply too heavy for me to shoulder.
87217|0x006B7DC0|Because this love is simply too~heavy for me to shoulder.
87218|0x006B7E21|There is no weight when it comes to love. You're just weak.
87219|0x006B7E67|There is no weight when it~comes to love. You're just~weak.
87220|0x006B7EBE|...You might be right.

87222|0x006B7F1D|Do you still want to return?

87225|0x006B7F8D|......
87226|0x006B7FBB|If you just can't believe in him, then go ahead and see what happens~if you leave him.
87227|0x006B801C|If you just can't believe in~him, then go ahead and see what~happens if you leave him.
87228|0x006B809A|Just try and make him grieve once, as a test.

87230|0x006B8129|As a test...
87231|0x006B8140|As a test...
87232|0x006B8174|If that will give you confidence, then go do it.

87236|0x006B82B6|I'm not part of this equation.
87237|0x006B82DF|I'm not part of this equation.
87238|0x006B8327|Be it only a test or whatever, would you still not get mad at me for~making him grieve?
87239|0x006B8389|Be it only a test or whatever,~would you still not get mad at~me for making him grieve?
87240|0x006B8408|...I don't care about You-kun one bit.
87241|0x006B8439|...I don't care about You-kun~one bit.
87242|0x006B8489|You really are defiant.
87243|0x006B84AB|You really are defiant.
87244|0x006B84EA|...Maybe I will send you back after all.
87245|0x006B851D|...Maybe I will send you back~after all.
87246|0x006B856F|Mare-san. Don't send me back, but please hit me with the shaft.
87247|0x006B85B9|Mare-san. Don't send me back,~but please hit me with the~shaft.
87248|0x006B8655|Hit me two times, precisely.
87249|0x006B867C|Hit me two times, precisely.
87250|0x006B86B4|Once as a punishment for having attacked you...
87251|0x006B86EE|Once as a punishment for having~attacked you...
87252|0x006B8747|And one more time as punishment for not having the self-confidence I~need to avoid hurting Kogasaka-san, even though I have every right to~love...
87253|0x006B87E4|And one more time as punishment~for not having the~self-confidence I need to avoid~hurting Kogasaka-san, even
87254|0x006B887B|You don't have to hold back, just hit me as hard as you can.
87255|0x006B88C2|You don't have to hold back,~just hit me as hard as you can.
87256|0x006B8944|...Got it.
87257|0x006B8959|...Got it.
87258|0x006B898B|Here I go then.
87259|0x006B89A5|Here I go then.
87260|0x006B8A0C|In deference to the blockhead you are, I'll smack you nice and good─
87261|0x006B8A5C|In deference to the blockhead~you are, I'll smack you nice~and good─
87262|0x006B8AFB|I'd meant to look for Mare right after getting to the lookout.
87263|0x006B8B44|I'd meant to look for Mare~right after getting to the~lookout.
87264|0x006B8BBF|But there was no need to look for her. She was right there.
87265|0x006B8C05|But there was no need to look~for her. She was right there.
87266|0x006B8C50|As if she'd been waiting for me to appear.
87267|0x006B8C85|As if she'd been waiting for me~to appear.
87268|0x006B8CFB|...Oh, you're here already.
87269|0x006B8D21|...Oh, you're here already.
87270|0x006B8D7C|Mare got a better grip on her scythe, which caused its blade to~reflect the moonlight and give off a silver glow.
87271|0x006B8DF8|Mare got a better grip on her~scythe, which caused its blade~to reflect the moonlight and~give off a silver glow.
87272|0x006B8ED2|Mare.
87273|0x006B8EE2|Mare.
87274|0x006B8F01|I ran up to Mare.
87275|0x006B8F1D|I ran up to Mare.
87276|0x006B8F61|Did Kosame-san come here?
87277|0x006B8F85|Did Kosame-san come here?
87278|0x006B8FC6|Who?
87279|0x006B8FD5|Who?
87280|0x006B8FF3|The girl who attacked you before.
87281|0x006B901F|The girl who attacked you~before.
87282|0x006B9068|Yeah, she did.
87283|0x006B9081|Yeah, she did.
87284|0x006B909F|But I couldn't see her anywhere.
87285|0x006B90CA|But I couldn't see her~anywhere.
87286|0x006B90FA|I did a quick survey of my surroundings, but there wasn't a single~trace of her anywhere.
87287|0x006B915E|I did a quick survey of my~surroundings, but there wasn't~a single trace of her anywhere.
87288|0x006B91D1|Kosame-san did come here, right?
87289|0x006B91FC|Kosame-san did come here,~right?
87290|0x006B9244|That's what I said.
87291|0x006B9262|That's what I said.
87292|0x006B928F|And then, what happened to her?
87293|0x006B92B9|And then, what happened to her?
87294|0x006B92E8|Anxiety coursed through my veins.
87295|0x006B9314|Anxiety coursed through my~veins.
87296|0x006B9345|If Kosame-san wanted to disappear from my side, that would mean having~someone send her back.
87297|0x006B93AD|If Kosame-san wanted to~disappear from my side, that~would mean having someone send~her back.
87298|0x006B941A|That's why this place was my first guess.

87300|0x006B9491|What happened to her...?

87302|0x006B94F4|She's gone.
87303|0x006B950A|She's gone.
87304|0x006B9525|At once, my anxiety skyrocketed.
87305|0x006B9550|At once, my anxiety~skyrocketed.
87306|0x006B958A|Do you mean... she left the lookout?
87307|0x006B95B9|Do you mean... she left the~lookout?
87308|0x006B9605|No. She's gone.
87309|0x006B961F|No. She's gone.
87310|0x006B9648|You mean...
87311|0x006B965E|You mean...
87312|0x006B9679|I needed courage to actually say the words.
87313|0x006B96AF|I needed courage to actually~say the words.
87314|0x006B96F4|You mean to say that she returned to the stars...?
87315|0x006B9731|You mean to say that she~returned to the stars...?
87316|0x006B978B|Yes.
87317|0x006B979A|Yes.

87322|0x006B9861|Mare gestured toward the woods with her scythe.
87323|0x006B989B|Mare gestured toward the woods~with her scythe.
87324|0x006B98E9|I saw a scarlet cloth on a long tree branch.
87325|0x006B9920|I saw a scarlet cloth on a long~tree branch.
87326|0x006B995C|It was her shrine maiden clothing.
87327|0x006B9989|It was her shrine maiden~clothing.
87328|0x006B99BB|That clothing, hanging from the tree like that, was like a nymph's~raiment.
87329|0x006B9A11|That clothing, hanging from the~tree like that, was like a~nymph's raiment.
87330|0x006B9AAE|That's what she was wearing.
87331|0x006B9AD5|That's what she was wearing.
87332|0x006B9B19|Unlike with me, it seems her clothes don't disappear along with her~too.
87333|0x006B9B6C|Unlike with me, it seems her~clothes don't disappear along~with her too.
87334|0x006B9BCE|...Disappear? Didn't she return to the stars?

87336|0x006B9C5B|My bad. She did return.

87340|0x006B9CED|You-kun... are you sad?

87346|0x006B9E0E|...No.
87347|0x006B9E1F|...No.
87348|0x006B9E35|Kosame-san returned to the stars without telling me anything.
87349|0x006B9E7D|Kosame-san returned to the~stars without telling me~anything.

87360|0x006BA0AB|...That's kind of a difficult question.
87361|0x006BA0DD|...That's kind of a difficult~question.
87362|0x006BA12C|That's not good...
87363|0x006BA149|That's not good...
87364|0x006BA16B|She panicked for some reason.
87365|0x006BA193|She panicked for some reason.
87366|0x006BA1D8|That would mean one of the hits wasn't warranted...
87367|0x006BA216|That would mean one of the hits~wasn't warranted...
87368|0x006BA259|(What's that supposed to mean?)

88864|0x006D54E8|That one really stings.

88872|0x006D56D0|The corners of her mouth rose to form a slight smile.
88873|0x006D5710|The corners of her mouth rose~to form a slight smile.
88874|0x006D5755|Merely seeing that smile on her face was enough for me.
88875|0x006D5797|Merely seeing that smile on her~face was enough for me.
88876|0x006D5866|Oh, Aoi-san. Morning.

88881|0x006D596F|Upon stepping out of my door, I~encountered Aoi-san in front of~my home.
88882|0x006D59C7|She would usually just pass by and make her way up the hill, but today~she was just standing there sort of like she was waiting for someone.

88888|0x006D5BD3|Yeah, didn't think so.

88892|0x006D5C81|Did you need to talk to her?
88893|0x006D5CA8|Did you need to talk to her?
88894|0x006D5CEE|Yes. Now tell me where that scoundrel is.
88895|0x006D5D22|Yes. Now tell me where that~scoundrel is.
88896|0x006D5D5B|Oh boy... God only knows what she did this time.
88897|0x006D5D96|Oh boy... God only knows what~she did this time.
88898|0x006D5DE0|She was rushing to get ready, so she should be here before long. Did~she do something?

88900|0x006D5EC1|Yes, she did.

88906|0x006D5F8E|You weren't angry last night though, were you?
88907|0x006D5FC7|You weren't angry last night~though, were you?
88908|0x006D601F|Thinking about it now, it was my mistake to not get mad at her before.
88909|0x006D6070|Thinking about it now, it was~my mistake to not get mad at~her before.
88910|0x006D60D0|Damn it, what did Chinami do this time?
88911|0x006D6102|Damn it, what did Chinami do~this time?
88912|0x006D6153|She took a bath with Suzuha.
88913|0x006D617A|She took a bath with Suzuha.
88914|0x006D61B0|...And, uh, why are you angry about that?
88915|0x006D61E4|...And, uh, why are you angry~about that?
88916|0x006D6237|After getting out of the bath, I have reason to believe that Suzuha~was playing together with Chinami-san.
88917|0x006D62AC|After getting out of the bath,~I have reason to believe that~Suzuha was playing together~with Chinami-san.
88918|0x006D6326|When we got back from our stargazing, the two of them were fast asleep~in the living room.
88919|0x006D638B|When we got back from our~stargazing, the two of them~were fast asleep in the living~room.
88920|0x006D6444|Their faces were simply precious, too.
88921|0x006D6475|Their faces were simply~precious, too.
88922|0x006D64B5|Since Shino-san had work to do, I wouldn't be surprised if the two of~them played together the entire time.
88923|0x006D652B|Since Shino-san had work to do,~I wouldn't be surprised if the~two of them played together the~entire time.
88924|0x006D65B2|That's what I think, too.
88925|0x006D65D6|That's what I think, too.
88926|0x006D65FF|I guess they were exhausted from playing, because neither of them~showed signs of waking up.
88927|0x006D6666|I guess they were exhausted~from playing, because neither~of them showed signs of waking~up.
88928|0x006D66D2|Aoi-san carried Suzuha-chan home on her back still asleep.
88929|0x006D6717|Aoi-san carried Suzuha-chan~home on her back still asleep.
88930|0x006D6761|I also carried Chinami to her room.
88931|0x006D678F|I also carried Chinami to her~room.
88932|0x006D6834|So, what's so bad about that?
88933|0x006D685C|So, what's so bad about that?
88934|0x006D68A3|The problem is Suzuha was fast asleep in the living room without so~much as a blanket over her, despite the fact that she gets cold easily~after taking a bath.
88935|0x006D694D|The problem is Suzuha was fast~asleep in the living room~without so much as a blanket~over her, despite the fact that

88942|0x006D6C82|Chinami-san, what did you do with Suzuha last night?
88943|0x006D6CC1|Chinami-san, what did you do~with Suzuha last night?

88949|0x006D6EA4|Your noogie has strengthened in~intensity, Aoi-chaaan!!
88950|0x006D6F27|...Did Suzuha-chan catch a cold, by any chance?
88951|0x006D6F61|...Did Suzuha-chan catch a~cold, by any chance?
88952|0x006D6FC0|Yes. She came down with a fever, and now she's resting in her room.

88958|0x006D71FB|...Suzuha-chan got sick?

88960|0x006D7250|Seems like it.
88961|0x006D7269|Seems like it.
88962|0x006D7287|Which meant she was taking the day off school today.
88963|0x006D72C6|Which meant she was taking the~day off school today.
88964|0x006D7314|That's gotta be why Aoi-san was so angry.
88965|0x006D7348|That's gotta be why Aoi-san was~so angry.
88966|0x006D739B|...Is it all my fault?

88968|0x006D73EC|You're not the only one to blame.
88969|0x006D7418|You're not the only one to~blame.
88970|0x006D7449|Because Shino-san was busy with work, she couldn't stay in the room~and watch over Suzuha-chan. And I still left the house despite knowing~that.

89023|0x006D83FB|...She gets fevers fairly~often, so it shouldn't be that~serious.
89024|0x006D8456|Well, if you think she ought to get her rest now, we'll hold off on~visiting.

89048|0x006D8BB2|This might be your chance, then.
89049|0x006D8BDD|This might be your chance,~then.

89053|0x006D8D15|You might get the rare~opportunity to see Chinami~quiet and behaved.
89054|0x006D8D69|When all's said and done, Chinami isn't one to purposefully go out and~cause trouble for those she cares about.

89072|0x006D9351|Well, it's not like anybody would complain about me missing a meeting~or two. Aside from the stargazing sessions on Fridays, the only thing~we really do in the club is chat.

89078|0x006D960E|Are your parents at work?

89080|0x006D968F|Yes. Neither of them will be home until really late.

89391|0x006DE4D4|She nodded silently.
89392|0x006DE4F8|I guess that explained why the house seemed new. It made sense that~they moved here.

89434|0x006DF2AF|There you're simply adding the variables together 'cause you don't~want your equation long and messy. These are symmetric polynomials, so~once you get the method for doing them down, they're cake.

91166|0x006FFF1E|...Who knows, that may be it. Apparently I had the highest attendance~rate out of everyone in the club.

91529|0x00707C2A|Yeah, I can see that! Japan is~famous for its planetariums,~after all!
91530|0x00707C9A|Right. In terms of size, the five most massive ones in the world are~all found here in Japan. In terms of quantity, though, America wins~out by a landslide.
91531|0x00707D41|Right. In terms of size, the~five most massive ones in the~world are all found here in~Japan. In terms of quantity,
91532|0x00707DFB|Come to think of it, they also sell planetariums commercially on~shelves, don't they?
91533|0x00707E5B|Come to think of it, they also~sell planetariums commercially~on shelves, don't they?
91534|0x00707EDA|Yep. Nowadays, indoor planetarium projectors can also be obtained for~cheap. If you've got a few tatami mats worth of space, you can even~project a sky full of stars onto your ceiling.

91536|0x00708067|...Then why don't you just buy one with our club funds instead of~going through the trouble of making one from scratch.

91544|0x00708528|Seeing as how you like the southern constellations so much, why not~buy your own household planetarium so you can look at it whenever?

91548|0x007086D1|Huh? You do?
91549|0x007086E8|Huh? You do?
91550|0x0070871E|Yes, it's in my room.
91551|0x0070873E|Yes, it's in my room.
91552|0x007087A0|...So, uhh, what was the point of that southern sky planetarium we~made then?
91553|0x007087F8|...So, uhh, what was the point~of that southern sky~planetarium we made then?
91554|0x0070888E|Do you still use that planetarium of yours?
91555|0x007088C4|Do you still use that~planetarium of yours?
91556|0x00708919|...No, it's sleeping somewhere in the deep depths of my closet.

91558|0x007089EA|You're not putting it to use?

91560|0x00708A59|...Yes. I wasn't too satisfied with it.
91561|0x00708A8B|...Yes. I wasn't too satisfied~with it.
91562|0x00708B02|I know what you mean there. Unless you have a dome, the image that~comes out'll be distorted no matter what you do.

91566|0x00708D1C|...So it seems.
91567|0x00708D36|...So it seems.
91568|0x00708D55|That's why Aoi-san decided to join the Astro Club after seeing our~homemade planetarium.
91569|0x00708DB8|That's why Aoi-san decided to~join the Astro Club after~seeing our homemade~planetarium.
91570|0x00708E55|Well, it's good to know we didn't waste our time with that.
91571|0x00708E9B|Well, it's good to know we~didn't waste our time with~that.
91572|0x00708F1C|Even though our planetarium is for all of our visitors at the Hibari~Festival, we'll have to make it the best we can for Aoi-san's sake as~well.

91577|0x00709112|Well, it's technically for~everyone, but that also~includes you, Aoi-san.
91578|0x0070916B|We decided on this because all of us also wanted to see the stars of~the southern sky once more.

91590|0x007094C9|Quite the demoralizing statement.

91602|0x007097BA|Seriously.
91603|0x007097CF|Seriously.

91618|0x00709D40|Is making the planetarium not fun to you?
91619|0x00709D74|Is making the planetarium not~fun to you?
91620|0x00709DC7|...It's fun at times... but also a lot of work.
91621|0x00709E01|...It's fun at times... but~also a lot of work.
91622|0x00709E75|That's the very essence of club life!

91636|0x0070A2BC|Since you ate it, you'll have to keep helping us till the very end!

91638|0x0070A377|Ngh... How underhanded.

91655|0x0070A953|Like this, we were able to get~Aoi-san to participate in our~preparations for the Hibari~Festival.
91656|0x0070A9C5|I still wanted her to warm up to us a bit more, but maybe that was~asking too much.
91657|0x0070AA23|I still wanted her to warm up~to us a bit more, but maybe~that was asking too much.
91658|0x0070AA86|Though, at the very least, it felt like she had slightly warmed up to~me compared to when we first met.

91663|0x0070ACFB|...So you decided to follow me~again?
91664|0x0070AD3A|Well, I can't not. I was entrusted with walking with you at night,~after all.
91665|0x0070AD92|Well, I can't not. I was~entrusted with walking with you~at night, after all.
91666|0x0070AE03|Despite being so half-hearted during our club meetings, she had a~considerable amount of diligence when it came to these nightly rooftop~bouts.

91668|0x0070AF25|She also ran the risk of being caught by the security, but~nevertheless, she brazenly snuck into the school building night by~night and unlocked the door to the rooftop to search for that starry~sky of the south.

91672|0x0070B10B|It's dangerous to walk alone.
91673|0x0070B133|It's dangerous to walk alone.
91674|0x0070B160|The fact that we hadn't gotten in trouble even once was testament to~how severly lacking Hibari High's security was.
91675|0x0070B1DF|The fact that we hadn't gotten~in trouble even once was~testament to how severly~lacking Hibari High's security

91688|0x0070B626|Yeah.

91691|0x0070B6A7|Then going to the lookout would~be a far better option.
91692|0x0070B6F8|But then you won't be there.

91699|0x0070B862|...How so?
91700|0x0070B886|It's more fun together with you.
91701|0x0070B8B1|It's more fun together with~you.
91702|0x0070B8FB|...Impossible.
91703|0x0070B914|...Impossible.
91704|0x0070B93C|Quite possible, I'd say.

91774|0x0070CF16|...Yes. That's what I think.
91775|0x0070CF3D|...Yes. That's what I think.
91776|0x0070CF69|Maybe Aoi-san was content with just that. And maybe the Astro Club~needed nothing more either.
91777|0x0070CFD2|Maybe Aoi-san was content with~just that. And maybe the Astro~Club needed nothing more~either.

92250|0x0071548E|Do you really believe that?
92251|0x007154B4|Do you really believe that?
92252|0x007154EB|......
92253|0x007154FC|......
92254|0x00715512|A brief pause.
92255|0x0071552B|A brief pause.
92256|0x00715563|...I do.
92257|0x00715576|...I do.
92258|0x00715598|This is just a guess.
92259|0x007155B8|This is just a guess.
92260|0x007155DD|I wasn't trying to reproach her.
92261|0x00715608|I wasn't trying to reproach~her.
92262|0x00715642|But is that also the reason why you skipped out on the Hibari~Festival?
92263|0x00715694|But is that also the reason why~you skipped out on the Hibari~Festival?
92264|0x007156EB|This was just me being pushy.
92265|0x00715713|This was just me being pushy.
92266|0x0071575A|...That was something else.
92267|0x00715780|...That was something else.
92268|0x007157AB|I held onto the vain hope that being pushy would maybe, just maybe~change something.
92269|0x0071580A|I held onto the vain hope that~being pushy would maybe, just~maybe change something.
92270|0x00715888|I had something to do on that day.
92271|0x007158B5|I had something to do on that~day.
92272|0x007158F1|That so.
92273|0x00715904|That so.
92274|0x00715936|Yes.
92275|0x00715945|Yes.
92276|0x00715963|That's a lie, isn't it?
92277|0x00715985|That's a lie, isn't it?
92278|0x007159C6|...You're welcome to believe what you want.
92279|0x007159FC|...You're welcome to believe~what you want.
92280|0x00715A41|I'm heading off to the club.
92281|0x00715A68|I'm heading off to the club.
92282|0x00715AAE|...Sure. Go right ahead.
92283|0x00715AD1|...Sure. Go right ahead.
92284|0x00715B03|All right then, see you again at dinnertime.
92285|0x00715B3A|All right then, see you again~at dinnertime.
92286|0x00715B76|She gave no reply.
92287|0x00715B93|She gave no reply.
92288|0x00715C50|So she's not coming today?
92289|0x00715C75|So she's not coming today?
92290|0x00715CA9|It seems like she's not feeling well.
92291|0x00715CD9|It seems like she's not feeling~well.
92292|0x00715D44|I wonder if her absence from the Hibari Festival was also because of~that...
92293|0x00715D9B|I wonder if her absence from~the Hibari Festival was also~because of that...
92294|0x00715E01|She doesn't have a cold or anything, so she should be fine.
92295|0x00715E47|She doesn't have a cold or~anything, so she should be~fine.
92296|0x00715EC7|Well, as long as it's nothing serious.
92297|0x00715EF8|Well, as long as it's nothing~serious.
92298|0x00715F2E|Everyone could probably tell that Aoi-san was skipping, but there~wasn't a single person who called her out for it.

92300|0x0071602F|This friendly atmosphere is one of the things I like about our club.
92301|0x0071607E|This friendly atmosphere is one~of the things I like about our~club.
92302|0x007160D2|...In that sense, forcing Aoi-san to participate was a braindead idea~no matter how you think about it.
92303|0x00716144|...In that sense, forcing~Aoi-san to participate was a~braindead idea no matter how~you think about it.
92304|0x007161DB|I reckon Hisakaki-kun and Setsuna-kun probably won't be showing, so~this makes everyone.
92305|0x0071623E|I reckon Hisakaki-kun and~Setsuna-kun probably won't be~showing, so this makes~everyone.
92306|0x007162C0|Let's begin the meeting. I brought snacks, so we can eat while we~talk.
92307|0x00716312|Let's begin the meeting. I~brought snacks, so we can eat~while we talk.
92308|0x00716383|I'll make us some tea as well.
92309|0x007163AC|I'll make us some tea as well.
92310|0x00716407|Since we were all still exhausted from the Hibari Festival, we decided~to take it easy.

92312|0x00716500|We're planning out what the club's gonna be doing from here on out,~right?
92313|0x00716555|We're planning out what the~club's gonna be doing from here~on out, right?
92314|0x007165C9|You got it. I was kinda thinking, like, maybe we could do something~besides our weekly stargazing sessions, y'know. We've sure got a lot~of free time on our hands now that the Hibari Festival's out of the~way.
92315|0x007166A5|You got it. I was kinda~thinking, like, maybe we could~do something besides our weekly~stargazing sessions, y'know.
92316|0x0071675D|However, don't forget that we have our midterms coming up here very~soon.

92324|0x00716B7B|If you're thinking of astronomy-related contests, they probably do~exist. Even if not here in Hibarigasaki, we may be able to participate~in ones hosted in other cities.

92326|0x00716CC7|In that case, I suppose an astrophotography competition would be the~most appropriate. There's a famous one for photographing auroras that~should take place somewhere near the end of the year.

92328|0x00716E2B|Ohh, that's neat. But when you say aurora, Northern Europe comes to~mind rather than Japan.
92329|0x00716E91|Ohh, that's neat. But when you~say aurora, Northern Europe~comes to mind rather than~Japan.
92330|0x00716F16|They can be seen in cold places, right?
92331|0x00716F48|They can be seen in cold~places, right?
92332|0x00716F99|Yes, but they're not limited to just there. It's a commonly held~misconception that auroras are only visible in Northern Europe. You~can actually view them here in Japan too.
92333|0x00717052|Yes, but they're not limited to~just there. It's a commonly~held misconception that auroras~are only visible in Northern
92334|0x007170E4|Yeah, I see them pop up on the news and whatnot every now and then.
92335|0x00717132|Yeah, I see them pop up on the~news and whatnot every now and~then.
92336|0x0071719F|You can get high-speed film relatively easily these days, so it's a~lot less hassle to photograph them. Perhaps that's why it's become a~popular activity with enthusiasts, as well as a common conversation~topic.

92340|0x007173B9|That's unexpected for someone who loves astronomy as much as you do.
92341|0x00717408|That's unexpected for someone~who loves astronomy as much as~you do.
92342|0x00717476|Well, constellations are my main interest. The legends and folklore~behind them are what got me into astronomy in the first place.

92344|0x007175BD|Is it easy for the average person to view an aurora in Japan?
92345|0x00717605|Is it easy for the average~person to view an aurora in~Japan?
92346|0x0071768E|Hmm, unlike the ones in Northern Europe, they'd be a lot weaker. It~used to be you could only photograph them once every ten years, but~now with the advancement of technology, you're able to photograph them~two or three times a year.
92347|0x00717782|Hmm, unlike the ones in~Northern Europe, they'd be a~lot weaker. It used to be you~could only photograph them once
92348|0x0071781E|Would we be able to see them here in Hibarigasaki?

92350|0x007178B7|That I don't know, but we could always look into it and see.
92351|0x007178FE|That I don't know, but we could~always look into it and see.
92352|0x00717964|It'd be cool if we could take a real picture of one!
92353|0x007179A3|It'd be cool if we could take a~real picture of one!
92354|0x007179F1|If we make it in time, maybe we could even enter it into the contest~too.
92355|0x00717A45|If we make it in time, maybe we~could even enter it into the~contest too.
92356|0x00717AD3|If it all goes well, we could have it entered with the title The~Hibarigasaki Aurora.

92358|0x00717BB2|Nice idea!
92359|0x00717BC7|Nice idea!
92360|0x00717BFB|Sounds like the perfect plan for our next club objective.
92361|0x00717C3F|Sounds like the perfect plan~for our next club objective.
92362|0x00717CA2|Then I guess we should start doing research on auroras?

92364|0x00717D35|I'm in favor.
92365|0x00717D4D|I'm in favor.
92366|0x00717D84|I also have no objections.
92367|0x00717DA9|I also have no objections.
92368|0x00717DED|We've got a unanimous decision then.
92369|0x00717E1C|We've got a unanimous decision~then.
92370|0x00717E9D|As such, the Astro Club will commence research on auroras from here on~out, and if fortune provides, we'll take a photo and enter it into a~competition!

92374|0x0071804D|Now I'm getting excited.
92375|0x00718070|Now I'm getting excited.
92376|0x007180B2|Me too! But man, I kinda regret not studying auroras a bit more.
92377|0x007180FD|Me too! But man, I kinda regret~not studying auroras a bit~more.
92378|0x00718181|If you'd been a part of the old Astronomy Club, you probably would've~at least had the opportunity to see one, if nothing else.
92379|0x0071820B|If you'd been a part of the old~Astronomy Club, you probably~would've at least had the~opportunity to see one, if

92381|0x007182F0|The planetarium at the science~center projected auroras~before.
92382|0x0071836E|Hm, so planetariums can project more than just stars?
92383|0x007183AE|Hm, so planetariums can project~more than just stars?
92384|0x0071840D|Sure can. The auroras they showed of Northern Europe were beautiful,~but the ones from Australia in the southern hemisphere were just out~of this world.
92385|0x007184B0|Sure can. The auroras they~showed of Northern Europe were~beautiful, but the ones from~Australia in the southern

92388|0x00718623|Did Aoi-san enjoy seeing those?
92389|0x0071864D|Did Aoi-san enjoy seeing those?
92390|0x00718696|I'd say so. Leaving aside the southern stars, her high attendance rate~might've been thanks to the auroras as well.
92391|0x00718714|I'd say so. Leaving aside the~southern stars, her high~attendance rate might've been~thanks to the auroras as well.
92392|0x007187CA|Man, actually seeing the southern auroras with your own two eyes would~be an unforgettable experience. Especially since you don't have to~deal with the cold weather down there in Australia.
92393|0x00718892|Man, actually seeing the~southern auroras with your own~two eyes would be an~unforgettable experience.
92394|0x00718922|Yeah, you'd need to wait outside for long hours to gaze at auroras~after all. I'm sure that it'd be a lot better of an experience if it~were warm.
92395|0x007189BF|Yeah, you'd need to wait~outside for long hours to gaze~at auroras after all. I'm sure~that it'd be a lot better of an

92397|0x00718ABD|I'd like to see one for myself~some day as well.
92398|0x00718B17|Man, just imagine if we could go to Australia on a school trip or~something!
92399|0x00718B6E|Man, just imagine if we could~go to Australia on a school~trip or something!
92400|0x00718BD4|We get to go on a school trip in our third year, right?
92401|0x00718C16|We get to go on a school trip~in our third year, right?
92402|0x00718CA7|Yeah! You can confirm, right, Okaizumi-senpai?
92403|0x00718CE0|Yeah! You can confirm, right,~Okaizumi-senpai?
92404|0x00718D38|Yep. Though the place we visited for our school excursion this spring~was Okinawa.
92405|0x00718D95|Yep. Though the place we~visited for our school~excursion this spring was~Okinawa.
92406|0x00718E11|Bleh, that's lame. Traveling inside Japan is no fun.
92407|0x00718E50|Bleh, that's lame. Traveling~inside Japan is no fun.
92408|0x00718EAE|...Okinawa had some nice, warm weather, so I won't complain.
92409|0x00718EF5|...Okinawa had some nice, warm~weather, so I won't complain.
92410|0x00718F5B|Hey, Kosame-chan. Can't you get Komomo-chan to use her authority as a~Student Council member to make the school trip somewhere abroad~instead?
92411|0x00718FF4|Hey, Kosame-chan. Can't you get~Komomo-chan to use her~authority as a Student Council~member to make the school trip
92412|0x00719082|You might be able to force her hand if you, uh, use the usual method.
92413|0x007190D2|You might be able to force her~hand if you, uh, use the usual~method.
92414|0x0071915C|I would be perfectly fine with that, but since Nee-san hates nothing~more than abuse of power, I may be forced to take more extreme~measures.
92415|0x007191F4|I would be perfectly fine with~that, but since Nee-san hates~nothing more than abuse of~power, I may be forced to take
92416|0x0071927A|I wonder what those extreme measures could be...
92417|0x007192B5|I wonder what those extreme~measures could be...
92418|0x0071930F|By the way, if we end up being able to do aurora photography, we might~want to look into extending our hours for stargazing.
92419|0x00719396|By the way, if we end up being~able to do aurora photography,~we might want to look into~extending our hours for
92420|0x00719430|True. We're currently only allowed use of the rooftop on Fridays.
92421|0x0071947C|True. We're currently only~allowed use of the rooftop on~Fridays.
92422|0x007194E7|And I guess the lookout is naturally out of the question.
92423|0x0071952B|And I guess the lookout is~naturally out of the question.
92424|0x0071958E|Yeah, we wouldn't want to be going there, since it's off-limits and~all.
92425|0x007195E1|Yeah, we wouldn't want to be~going there, since it's~off-limits and all.
92426|0x00719653|And even if we did use it in secret, our club would be in danger of~abolishment once again if Nee-san found out about it.
92427|0x007196D7|And even if we did use it in~secret, our club would be in~danger of abolishment once~again if Nee-san found out
92428|0x00719760|Yeah, she said she is our supervisor after all.
92429|0x0071979A|Yeah, she said she is our~supervisor after all.
92430|0x00719816|How about borrowing Aoi-san's rooftop key?
92431|0x0071984B|How about borrowing Aoi-san's~rooftop key?
92432|0x0071988F|I can't see her lending it to us.
92433|0x007198BB|I can't see her lending it to~us.
92434|0x00719921|Even assuming she did, we'd still have the same problem of our club~being at risk once Nee-san found out.
92435|0x00719995|Even assuming she did, we'd~still have the same problem of~our club being at risk once~Nee-san found out.
92436|0x00719A28|...Then I guess we'll just have to ask the school if we can get more~time for the rooftop.
92437|0x00719A8D|...Then I guess we'll just have~to ask the school if we can get~more time for the rooftop.
92438|0x00719B2B|We'll probably have to use Hisakaki-kun as our avenue again.
92439|0x00719B72|We'll probably have to use~Hisakaki-kun as our avenue~again.
92440|0x00719BC8|Should we let Kosame-san take care of that?
92441|0x00719BFE|Should we let Kosame-san take~care of that?
92442|0x00719C53|As long as I go at her with the resolve to steal her virginity, it~should work out just fine.
92443|0x00719CBB|As long as I go at her with the~resolve to steal her virginity,~it should work out just fine.
92444|0x00719D42|...That sounds just a little bit illegal to me.
92445|0x00719D7C|...That sounds just a little~bit illegal to me.
92446|0x00719DD5|If Hisakaki-kun is our so-called supervisor, then she might be willing~to bring it up with the Student Council as long as she can see her~we're taking the club seriously.
92447|0x00719E8A|If Hisakaki-kun is our~so-called supervisor, then she~might be willing to bring it up~with the Student Council as
92448|0x00719F0B|That shouldn't pose a problem since she had observed us well enough~over the summer break. All we needed now was one final push.
92449|0x00719F96|That shouldn't pose a problem~since she had observed us well~enough over the summer break.~All we needed now was one final
92450|0x0071A03A|I'll see if I can get around to asking her about it. Who knows,~there's a chance we'll get the approval right away.
92451|0x0071A0B8|I'll see if I can get around to~asking her about it. Who knows,~there's a chance we'll get the~approval right away.
92452|0x0071A155|...Eh, you think so? Knowing her, I feel like she'll just find the~teensiest thing to use as a reason why we shouldn't.
92453|0x0071A1D7|...Eh, you think so? Knowing~her, I feel like she'll just~find the teensiest thing to use~as a reason why we shouldn't.
92454|0x0071A268|Either way, the fact of the matter is we'll have to convince Hisakaki~that we're deserving of it.
92455|0x0071A2D4|Either way, the fact of the~matter is we'll have to~convince Hisakaki that we're~deserving of it.
92456|0x0071A35F|Looks like we can add that to our agenda as well.
92457|0x0071A39B|Looks like we can add that to~our agenda as well.
92458|0x0071A3DC|Although the Hibari Festival had ended, the Astro Club was still just~as busy as always.
92459|0x0071A43F|Although the Hibari Festival~had ended, the Astro Club was~still just as busy as always.
92460|0x0071A4CE|The only thing missing... was Aoi-san. Honestly, it felt quite lonely~here without her.

93136|0x007292CB|Well, I guess that means we'll have to focus on upping Aoi-kun's~attendance rate first and foremost.

93138|0x007293E2|She didn't come today either...
93139|0x0072940C|She didn't come today either...
93140|0x00729445|I live right next door to her, so I'll ask her later. I'll also bring~up the matter with the rooftop and see how that goes.

93142|0x00729596|I guess that means we'll be leaving most of it in your hands.
93143|0x007295DE|I guess that means we'll be~leaving most of it in your~hands.
93144|0x00729645|If there's anything we can help with, just tell us.

93146|0x007296C6|The real question here was how in hell I was going to persuade~Aoi-san.

93148|0x0072976F|I'd learned from experience that being forceful only resulted in her~increasing her distance.
93149|0x007297D7|I'd learned from experience~that being forceful only~resulted in her increasing her~distance.
93150|0x00729844|But if I wasn't a little bit forceful, nothing at all would happen.
93151|0x00729892|But if I wasn't a little bit~forceful, nothing at all would~happen.
93152|0x007298E5|The problem I had to think about now was how exactly I was going to~formulate my game plan.
93153|0x0072994B|The problem I had to think~about now was how exactly I was~going to formulate my game~plan.
93154|0x007299F4|Aoi-kun's a formidable foe, so we should think things over thoroughly~before we act.
93155|0x00729A53|Aoi-kun's a formidable foe, so~we should think things over~thoroughly before we act.
93156|0x00729ADF|...Senpai, would it be possible for us to make a planetarium that can~project auroras?
93157|0x00729B40|...Senpai, would it be possible~for us to make a planetarium~that can project auroras?
93158|0x00729BC0|Hm, you want to reproduce an aurora?
93159|0x00729BEF|Hm, you want to reproduce an~aurora?
93160|0x00729C2D|That's what I was thinking. Apparently Aoi-san likes the southern~auroras.
93161|0x00729C82|That's what I was thinking.~Apparently Aoi-san likes the~southern auroras.
93162|0x00729D10|Makes sense. If you're looking at the starry skies in the south, then~I suppose you will see auroras as well.
93163|0x00729D88|Makes sense. If you're looking~at the starry skies in the~south, then I suppose you will~see auroras as well.
93164|0x00729E45|Ahh, how nice! I'm totally jealous!
93165|0x00729E73|Ahh, how nice! I'm totally~jealous!
93166|0x00729EC0|So that means we're going back to what we originally baited her in~with in the first place, are we?
93167|0x00729F2E|So that means we're going back~to what we originally baited~her in with in the first place,~are we?
93168|0x00729FA1|The way she worded that was a bit questionable, but that pretty much~summed it up.
93169|0x00729FFE|The way she worded that was a~bit questionable, but that~pretty much summed it up.
93170|0x0072A07A|...Well the problem is, it'd be possible if it were the science~center's planetarium, but I'm not so sure if we can show an aurora~with an amateur one.

93173|0x0072A1E4|That was also one of the things~that concerned me.
93174|0x0072A26C|I wouldn't quite say it's impossible. For example, we could always~combine the planetarium with an interior light that projects~aurora-like patterns.
93175|0x0072A30C|I wouldn't quite say it's~impossible. For example, we~could always combine the~planetarium with an interior
93176|0x0072A3A1|But, yeah... frankly, I wouldn't expect that to work very well. Unlike~ordinary stars, the colors of an aurora are something you can only~appreciate when they're natural.

93178|0x0072A4EE|It won't even start to look like the real deal unless you have a~considerable amount of equipment on-hand. I don't think Aoi-kun would~be satisfied with just a cheap-looking replica.
93179|0x0072A5AF|It won't even start to look~like the real deal unless you~have a considerable amount of~equipment on-hand. I don't
93180|0x0072A665|Ohh, so was that the reason why you went to visit the science center?
93181|0x0072A6B5|Ohh, so was that the reason why~you went to visit the science~center?
93182|0x0072A714|Err, not quite. I met Aoi-san there when I went to visit, and it was~only after that I heard about her liking auroras.
93183|0x0072A795|Err, not quite. I met Aoi-san~there when I went to visit, and~it was only after that I heard~about her liking auroras.
93184|0x0072A835|Wow. So she still visits the place even though it's closed down. That~just goes to show how attached she is to the planetarium at the~science center.
93185|0x0072A8D5|Wow. So she still visits the~place even though it's closed~down. That just goes to show~how attached she is to the
93186|0x0072A957|It only reinforced just how strongly Aoi-san missed the ever so~distant starry skies of the south.
93187|0x0072A9C4|It only reinforced just how~strongly Aoi-san missed the~ever so distant starry skies of~the south.
93188|0x0072AA50|Or even better, it'd be super cool if we could all go watch a~planetarium show at the science center.
93189|0x0072AAC0|Or even better, it'd be super~cool if we could all go watch a~planetarium show at the science~center.
93190|0x0072AB4F|Even if it's closed down, the machinery probably still works, so yeah,~it'd be great if they let us use it.

93192|0x0072AC80|I couldn't think of a greater gift we could give to Aoi-san if we~received permission for that.
93193|0x0072ACEA|I couldn't think of a greater~gift we could give to Aoi-san~if we received permission for~that.
93194|0x0072AD73|I'd be happy if she comes around and accepts the case, too.
93195|0x0072ADB9|I'd be happy if she comes~around and accepts the case,~too.
93196|0x0072AE0E|Why was the science center even closed down in the first place?
93197|0x0072AE58|Why was the science center even~closed down in the first place?
93198|0x0072AEDD|I'm not sure on the official reason. The extent of my knowledge is~that it was the town's judgment.

93202|0x0072B0F1|It might be worth trying to negotiate with the town hall one day.
93203|0x0072B13D|It might be worth trying to~negotiate with the town hall~one day.
93204|0x0072B18E|...Err actually, I should do that as soon as possible. Nothing would~change if we just went back and forth all day about it.

93208|0x0072B39B|Okay then, how about we all go ask right now?

93210|0x0072B41A|Sounds like a plan. Let's head to the town hall.
93211|0x0072B455|Sounds like a plan. Let's head~to the town hall.
93212|0x0072B4C4|No, not there. I meant we all go to the cafe.
93213|0x0072B4FC|No, not there. I meant we all~go to the cafe.
93214|0x0072B543|...Eh, I'm not all that hungry right now.
93215|0x0072B577|...Eh, I'm not all that hungry~right now.
93216|0x0072B5D0|I didn't mean we'd go there to eat.

93264|0x0072C868|That's nothing more than gossip. The director's a bit shy around the~public, so maybe that's why people suspected that he quit.

93576|0x007334A2|I wasn't always like I am now.

93578|0x00733507|Perhaps I was once the same as Aoi-san.

93584|0x00733704|I bet a real planetarium projector is several times cooler than the~ones we made.

93609|0x00733F81|Just stand there... stand there~and cry...
93610|0x00733FC7|I was so upset over the fact that I was so helpless, so I just cried,~and cried endlessly.

93672|0x007357DD|He gave it to me along with the key to the rooftop.
93673|0x0073581B|He gave it to me along with the~key to the rooftop.
93674|0x0073586A|He said that with those two things, I could see the universe whenever~I wanted.

93809|0x00737C88|I responded, promising her I~would do just that.
93810|0x00737CE7|Everything from here on out mostly depended on the director now.
93811|0x00737D32|Everything from here on out~mostly depended on the director~now.
93812|0x00737D82|If he gave Aoi-san the telescope with the same feelings that I had,~then this would go well.
93813|0x00737DE9|If he gave Aoi-san the~telescope with the same~feelings that I had, then this~would go well.
93814|0x00737E55|It would definitely go well.
93815|0x00737E7C|It would definitely go well.
93816|0x00737F50|Perfect timing. Dad's talking to the director on the phone right now!
93817|0x00737FA0|Perfect timing. Dad's talking~to the director on the phone~right now!
93818|0x00737FFA|I waited for school to end, and like yesterday, came to the cafe with~everyone.
93819|0x00738054|I waited for school to end, and~like yesterday, came to the~cafe with everyone.
93820|0x007380D3|He's probably asking whether or not we can use the science center's~planetarium.
93821|0x0073812E|He's probably asking whether or~not we can use the science~center's planetarium.
93822|0x007381C5|I've also been wanting to see it at least once, so it gets me excited~just thinking about it.
93823|0x0073822D|I've also been wanting to see~it at least once, so it gets me~excited just thinking about it.
93824|0x007382B4|Oh, you've never seen it before?
93825|0x007382DF|Oh, you've never seen it~before?
93826|0x00738329|I have not. But you have, right?
93827|0x00738354|I have not. But you have,~right?
93828|0x0073839E|Just a few times, yeah. The planetarium show they had for the closing~ceremony, man that was amazing, let me tell you!
93829|0x0073841F|Just a few times, yeah. The~planetarium show they had for~the closing ceremony, man that~was amazing, let me tell you!
93830|0x007384ED|Everyone in the Astronomy Club went to the final screening, so I can~only imagine I had the same impression, but for some strange reason I~just can't seem to remember.
93831|0x0073859F|Everyone in the Astronomy Club~went to the final screening, so~I can only imagine I had the~same impression, but for some
93832|0x00738628|Maybe it had something to do with the protests he was doing to try and~prevent the science center from being closed down...
93833|0x007386AE|Maybe it had something to do~with the protests he was doing~to try and prevent the science~center from being closed
93834|0x0073876A|Asuho, what was the final planetarium show like?
93835|0x007387A5|Asuho, what was the final~planetarium show like?
93836|0x007387FF|Well, it was the finale, so as you can expect, it was crazy exciting!~You could hear the applause echoing throughout the entire dome once~the show was over.
93837|0x007388A6|Well, it was the finale, so as~you can expect, it was crazy~exciting! You could hear the~applause echoing throughout the
93838|0x0073893A|And another cool thing. Once the lights in the dome turned on, the~staff members all formed a circle around the projector and greeted us~one by one.
93839|0x007389D9|And another cool thing. Once~the lights in the dome turned~on, the staff members all~formed a circle around the
93840|0x00738A72|Who knows, maybe the director was also in there somewhere!
93841|0x00738AB7|Who knows, maybe the director~was also in there somewhere!
93842|0x00738B39|I've heard he was really shy around the public, so I'm not too sure he~was. I've never even seen his face either.
93843|0x00738BB5|I've heard he was really shy~around the public, so I'm not~too sure he was. I've never~even seen his face either.
93844|0x00738C75|I see he was quite the humble person.
93845|0x00738CA5|I see he was quite the humble~person.
93846|0x00738D2C|Rather, he just got nervous being the center of attention.
93847|0x00738D71|Rather, he just got nervous~being the center of attention.
93848|0x00738DBB|Asuho's dad popped his face out from behind the counter.
93849|0x00738DFE|Asuho's dad popped his face out~from behind the counter.
93850|0x00738E8C|He's always been that way ever since I was still in school.
93851|0x00738ED2|He's always been that way ever~since I was still in school.
93852|0x00738F27|Oh? You two must go way back.
93853|0x00738F4F|Oh? You two must go way back.
93854|0x00738FB2|Were you and the director classmates?
93855|0x00738FE2|Were you and the director~classmates?
93856|0x00739031|Actually, he was a teacher back then. He started there when I was a~student.
93857|0x00739088|Actually, he was a teacher back~then. He started there when I~was a student.
93858|0x00739125|So that makes him older than you.
93859|0x00739151|So that makes him older than~you.
93860|0x0073919C|Well, we aren't even ten years apart, so we're able to get along as~pals now.
93861|0x007391F4|Well, we aren't even ten years~apart, so we're able to get~along as pals now.
93862|0x00739278|He went from being a teacher to being the director of the science~center?
93863|0x007392CC|He went from being a teacher to~being the director of the~science center?
93864|0x0073933F|That's right. It was about ten years after I graduated. The previous~director at the time was getting old and needed somebody to take over~his position, so he was chosen on the town's recommendation.
93865|0x00739411|That's right. It was about ten~years after I graduated. The~previous director at the time~was getting old and needed
93866|0x007394AF|Since he was rather young for the position, people were pretty~surprised.
93867|0x00739503|Since he was rather young for~the position, people were~pretty surprised.
93868|0x00739576|Even so, he had an extensive knowledge of astronomy ─ especially~when it came to telescopes and planetariums. They say there was~basically not a single person against him taking on the position.
93869|0x00739644|Even so, he had an extensive~knowledge of astronomy ─~especially when it came to~telescopes and planetariums.
93870|0x00739702|There aren't any classes about astronomy in Hibari High, so I'm~guessing he used to teach a general science or physics course.
93871|0x0073978B|There aren't any classes about~astronomy in Hibari High, so~I'm guessing he used to teach a~general science or physics
93872|0x0073982B|Yeah. I think he majored in astronomy at university, though.
93873|0x00739872|Yeah. I think he majored in~astronomy at university,~though.
93874|0x007398D8|Even I don't know much about why he chose to switch to a teaching~career.
93875|0x0073992C|Even I don't know much about~why he chose to switch to a~teaching career.
93876|0x007399C4|So? How did the call go?
93877|0x007399E7|So? How did the call go?
93878|0x00739A29|Seemed like he was doing all right. We had a lot to catch up on, so~the call dragged on for quite a while.
93879|0x00739A9E|Seemed like he was doing all~right. We had a lot to catch up~on, so the call dragged on for~quite a while.
93880|0x00739B38|And the planetarium?
93881|0x00739B57|And the planetarium?
93882|0x00739B95|...Hm?
93883|0x00739BA6|...Hm?
93884|0x00739BD6|I'm talking about whether he gave us permission to use the~planetarium. You asked him, didn't you?
93885|0x00739C43|I'm talking about whether he~gave us permission to use the~planetarium. You asked him,~didn't you?
93886|0x00739CD5|...Well, I'll be damned. I was so caught up talking about old times I~completely forgot to.
93887|0x00739D3B|...Well, I'll be damned. I was~so caught up talking about old~times I completely forgot to.
93888|0x00739DCC|Oh my god! You had one job, Dad!!
93889|0x00739DF8|Oh my god! You had one job,~Dad!!
93890|0x00739E64|...If it's not too much trouble, could you ask him for us next time?
93891|0x00739EB3|...If it's not too much~trouble, could you ask him for~us next time?
93892|0x00739F07|He didn't give an immediate response.
93893|0x00739F37|He didn't give an immediate~response.
93894|0x00739FA4|It doesn't seem like he really wants to...
93895|0x00739FD9|It doesn't seem like he really~wants to...
93896|0x0073A02D|Hmm, you could say so. I'm still opposed to this, for what it's worth.
93897|0x0073A07E|Hmm, you could say so. I'm~still opposed to this, for what~it's worth.
93898|0x0073A112|What literal reason is there to be? You even said that the director~would be happy about it!
93899|0x0073A179|What literal reason is there to~be? You even said that the~director would be happy about~it!
93900|0x0073A205|It's a problem for me, not for him. More importantly, I've never asked~you guys this yet, but...
93901|0x0073A270|It's a problem for me, not for~him. More importantly, I've~never asked you guys this yet,~but...
93902|0x0073A317|He scanned all our faces in a serious manner.
93903|0x0073A34F|He scanned all our faces in a~serious manner.
93904|0x0073A398|Why exactly do you want to see the planetarium?
93905|0x0073A3D2|Why exactly do you want to see~the planetarium?
93906|0x0073A46A|Nobody offered him any answer.
93907|0x0073A493|Nobody offered him any answer.
93908|0x0073A4C1|It wasn't that they couldn't ─ it looked like they were letting me~answer since this was my idea in the first place.
93909|0x0073A541|It wasn't that they couldn't~─ it looked like they were~letting me answer since this~was my idea in the first place.
93910|0x0073A5C6|So I responded.
93911|0x0073A5E0|So I responded.
93912|0x0073A658|We want to let this girl, Aoi-san, see the science center's~planetarium once more.
93913|0x0073A6B5|We want to let this girl,~Aoi-san, see the science~center's planetarium once more.
93914|0x0073A731|...Aoi-san?
93915|0x0073A747|...Aoi-san?
93916|0x0073A76C|Aoi Isuzu. She's a member of our club.
93917|0x0073A79D|Aoi Isuzu. She's a member of~our club.
93918|0x0073A809|I'm pretty sure you met her during our beach trip.
93919|0x0073A846|I'm pretty sure you met her~during our beach trip.
93920|0x0073A888|He nodded when he remembered her.
93921|0x0073A8B4|He nodded when he remembered~her.
93922|0x0073A8FF|I only saw her in photos, but that's the Aoi family's little girl,~huh? She's really grown... though really she's just as tiny and~adorable as she was back then.
93923|0x0073A9AB|I only saw her in photos, but~that's the Aoi family's little~girl, huh? She's really~grown... though really she's
93924|0x0073AA46|...You used to know her?
93925|0x0073AA69|...You used to know her?
93926|0x0073AAAB|Did that girl ever tell you that she and her family moved here seven~years ago?
93927|0x0073AB05|Did that girl ever tell you~that she and her family moved~here seven years ago?
93928|0x0073AB7E|Really?
93929|0x0073AB90|Really?
93930|0x0073ABED|This is my first time hearing about it.
93931|0x0073AC1F|This is my first time hearing~about it.
93932|0x0073AC90|Well, she doesn't really like talking about herself much.
93933|0x0073ACD4|Well, she doesn't really like~talking about herself much.
93934|0x0073AD1D|I had heard from Aoi-san herself, but it didn't look like anyone else~knew about it.
93935|0x0073AD7C|I had heard from Aoi-san~herself, but it didn't look~like anyone else knew about it.
93936|0x0073ADE0|However, like the rest of them, I didn't know when it happened.
93937|0x0073AE2A|However, like the rest of them,~I didn't know when it happened.
93938|0x0073AE79|So seven years would mean Aoi-san moved here to Hibarigasaki around~when my family moved off to the city.
93939|0x0073AEED|So seven years would mean~Aoi-san moved here to~Hibarigasaki around when my~family moved off to the city.
93940|0x0073AFB7|See, Isuzu-chan's parents were colleagues of mine. Well, I suppose I~should say former colleagues.
93941|0x0073B024|See, Isuzu-chan's parents were~colleagues of mine. Well, I~suppose I should say former~colleagues.
93942|0x0073B096|This part was also news to me.
93943|0x0073B0BF|This part was also news to me.
93944|0x0073B0F7|So Aoi-san's parents...
93945|0x0073B119|So Aoi-san's parents...
93946|0x0073B15A|They were both researchers in astronomy, yep. And still are, actually.~Apparently the two of them met each other through their job and~eventually got married.
93947|0x0073B203|They were both researchers in~astronomy, yep. And still are,~actually. Apparently the two of~them met each other through

93949|0x0073B2D6|He then narrowed his eyes as if~looking back fondly at the~past.
93950|0x0073B340|While I say they were my colleagues, we only worked together for a~short time. They were eventually relocated overseas to Australia.
93951|0x0073B3CF|While I say they were my~colleagues, we only worked~together for a short time. They~were eventually relocated
93952|0x0073B458|The few astronomical facilities where you can study the southern skies~from are all located in Australia, the country that is famous for its~Southern Cross constellation. Countless scientists have been~dispatched there from Japan.
93953|0x0073B549|The few astronomical facilities~where you can study the~southern skies from are all~located in Australia, the

93956|0x0073B70E|So that girl in your club, Isuzu-chan, she was born and raised with~the stars of the southern hemisphere above her.
93957|0x0073B78C|So that girl in your club,~Isuzu-chan, she was born and~raised with the stars of the~southern hemisphere above her.
93958|0x0073B80F|The story all made sense to us.
93959|0x0073B839|The story all made sense to us.
93960|0x0073B868|The starry sky of the southern hemisphere that Aoi-san yearned for was~something like a home to her, so to speak.
93961|0x0073B8E4|The starry sky of the southern~hemisphere that Aoi-san yearned~for was something like a home~to her, so to speak.
93962|0x0073B97F|Their workplace was a newly-constructed observatory. I heard that they~decided to raise little Isuzu-chan there instead of sending her to a~daycare.
93963|0x0073BA1E|Their workplace was a~newly-constructed observatory.~I heard that they decided to~raise little Isuzu-chan there
93964|0x0073BAB7|That being said, she didn't have much of an interest in stars,~apparently. They were a little disappointed over it, to be honest.
93965|0x0073BB43|That being said, she didn't~have much of an interest in~stars, apparently. They were a~little disappointed over it, to
93966|0x0073BBE3|Even so, Isuzu-chan became really attached to the researchers who~worked at the observatory.
93967|0x0073BC4A|Even so, Isuzu-chan became~really attached to the~researchers who worked at the~observatory.
93968|0x0073BCC2|So when it was decided that they'd return to Japan, she was severely~depressed.
93969|0x0073BD1C|So when it was decided that~they'd return to Japan, she was~severely depressed.
93970|0x0073BDAA|I finally understood now.
93971|0x0073BDCE|I finally understood now.
93972|0x0073BDF7|It explained why Aoi-san always tried to distance herself from~everyone else.
93973|0x0073BE4F|It explained why Aoi-san always~tried to distance herself from~everyone else.
93974|0x0073BEAC|It explained why she hates working together in groups.
93975|0x0073BEED|It explained why she hates~working together in groups.
93976|0x0073BF33|It explained why she never tried to ever make friends.
93977|0x0073BF74|It explained why she never~tried to ever make friends.
93978|0x0073BFBA|She feared the possible, eventual parting and the ensuing pain should~she get too close to someone.
93979|0x0073C028|She feared the possible,~eventual parting and the~ensuing pain should she get too~close to someone.
93980|0x0073C0CE|...Did they come back to Japan for work-related reasons?
93981|0x0073C111|...Did they come back to Japan~for work-related reasons?
93982|0x0073C173|No, it actually had to do with their second child.
93983|0x0073C1B0|No, it actually had to do with~their second child.
93984|0x0073C228|Suzuha-chan?
93985|0x0073C23F|Suzuha-chan?
93986|0x0073C275|Yeah. Their second little girl was born with some complications, or so~I heard. It was tough for her to live in Australia's environment.
93987|0x0073C308|Yeah. Their second little girl~was born with some~complications, or so I heard.~It was tough for her to live in
93988|0x0073C3C7|If they lived near the observatory, then I imagine it would have been~quite hard on her body.
93989|0x0073C42F|If they lived near the~observatory, then I imagine it~would have been quite hard on~her body.
93990|0x0073C4B6|Observatories have to be built on high ground, after all. Hot in the~daytime and cold at night. The land was arid too, which spelled little~precipitation and frequent water outages.

93992|0x0073C633|Suzuha-chan fell ill quite a lot. That's why they decided returning to~Japan was what was best.
93993|0x0073C69D|Suzuha-chan fell ill quite a~lot. That's why they decided~returning to Japan was what was~best.
93994|0x0073C726|Even on the front of medical care, Japan is easier to live in. They~also consulted me about it as a fellow colleague, and so I suggested~that they come back.
93995|0x0073C7CE|Even on the front of medical~care, Japan is easier to live~in. They also consulted me~about it as a fellow colleague,
93996|0x0073C88B|And that's when they came back to Hibarigasaki, huh?
93997|0x0073C8CA|And that's when they came back~to Hibarigasaki, huh?
93998|0x0073C928|Now they work at a research institute in the next town over. The~research data they brought back from Australia should be helping them~a whole lot.
93999|0x0073C9C6|Now they work at a research~institute in the next town~over. The research data they~brought back from Australia
94000|0x0073CA83|So, I've been thinking. Aoi-san was in elementary school when she~moved here, right?
94001|0x0073CAE2|So, I've been thinking. Aoi-san~was in elementary school when~she moved here, right?
94002|0x0073CB60|That sounds about right. Their second little girl, Suzuha-chan, was~around two at the time.
94003|0x0073CBC6|That sounds about right. Their~second little girl,~Suzuha-chan, was around two at~the time.
94004|0x0073CC4B|But I don't remember there being any transfer students at my~elementary school.
94005|0x0073CCA5|But I don't remember there~being any transfer students at~my elementary school.
94006|0x0073CD10|Well, Isuzu-chan was raised in Australia, so first she had to attend a~Japanese language school. After studying there and learning the~language, she went on to a normal middle school.
94007|0x0073CDD2|Well, Isuzu-chan was raised in~Australia, so first she had to~attend a Japanese language~school. After studying there
94008|0x0073CE97|That would explain why Aoi-kun didn't talk much in the Astronomy Club.~She just couldn't speak Japanese all that well.
94009|0x0073CF18|That would explain why Aoi-kun~didn't talk much in the~Astronomy Club. She just~couldn't speak Japanese all
94010|0x0073CF93|Or if you look at it from a different perspective, it meant she loved~the science center enough to go there despite not having a good grasp~on the language.
94011|0x0073D03A|Or if you look at it from a~different perspective, it meant~she loved the science center~enough to go there despite not
94012|0x0073D0FE|Aoi-san gazed at the planetarium in order to distract herself from the~loneliness of being taken away to this strange, foreign land.

94014|0x0073D202|Just like how I stared up into the city's night sky after being~separated from the girl from the lookout.
94015|0x0073D276|Just like how I stared up into~the city's night sky after~being separated from the girl~from the lookout.

94106|0x0073F288|Being the one who was also against his daughter joining the Astro Club~in the first place, he wasn't able to conceal the displeasure on his~face on days like this, where she went off stargazing late at night.
