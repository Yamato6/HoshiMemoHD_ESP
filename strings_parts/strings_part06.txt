45409|0x003C45E5|As for where she used to live~before she wound up in the~hospital, that was equally~unclear.
45410|0x003C4651|Apparently, they did inquire about what her disease was, and when she~first ended up in the hospital, on the off chance he'd tell them, but~instead they just got reprimanded.

45413|0x003C47FA|He told them those weren't the~kinds of things they ought to~be asking out of plain~curiosity.
45414|0x003C4868|Of course I had more than just idle curiosity about Yume's condition,~but I absolutely agreed with their father on this one, so I had~apologize to Hisakaki and Kosame-san.
45415|0x003C491E|Of course I had more than just~idle curiosity about Yume's~condition, but I absolutely~agreed with their father on

45418|0x003C4A88|Yeah, later on down the road it should.
45419|0x003C4ABA|Yeah, later on down the road it~should.
45420|0x003C4B25|In other words, it's not an answer you have right now. Well, when it~comes to the things we asked about, I do think you're gonna have to~ask her herself to get the answers you're looking for.

45443|0x003C5306|So yeah, I want to talk with~her alone, if that's all right?
45444|0x003C5386|Honestly, I was just worried about something.
45445|0x003C53BE|Honestly, I was just worried~about something.
45446|0x003C53FB|I still wondered if the Yume in the hospital was different than the~girl I used to play with.
45447|0x003C5463|I still wondered if the Yume in~the hospital was different than~the girl I used to play with.
45448|0x003C54D0|Anxiety rose inside of me to the point that I even began to wonder~whether the girl from the lookout really existed in the first place.
45449|0x003C5562|Anxiety rose inside of me to~the point that I even began to~wonder whether the girl from~the lookout really existed in
45450|0x003C55E8|Even as ludicrous of a thought as it is, the idea that she might have~just been a hallucination of my younger self also surfaced.

45455|0x003C580A|Ah... You-kun.

45481|0x003C5EFB|Well, yesterday, you didn't~really seem satisfied with our~conversation.
45482|0x003C5F5F|But since you didn't know how to talk about it, you left early. At~least that's how it came off to me.

45612|0x003C7FFB|Let me clarify.
45613|0x003C8015|Let me clarify.
45614|0x003C804D|I didn't mean it like my condition got worse or anything. It's just~that I got told off for going outside without permission.

45629|0x003C8614|Hmm, I haven't met either of~them, though. I reckon their~father told them that.
45630|0x003C867E|So you were walking around outside even though you just transferred~here?
45631|0x003C86D2|So you were walking around~outside even though you just~transferred here?
45632|0x003C8737|Yeah, I got the itch to go look around Hibarigasaki.
45633|0x003C8776|Yeah, I got the itch to go look~around Hibarigasaki.
45634|0x003C87C4|I can see that. It's been a while, after all.

45637|0x003C8892|Sure has. Man, that hill is~still just as long, let me tell~you...
45638|0x003C88FD|Ah! No, I just meant it seemed long when I climbed it for the first~time.
45639|0x003C8951|Ah! No, I just meant it seemed~long when I climbed it for the~first time.
45640|0x003C89B4|You totally stood out since you were walking around in your pajamas.

45703|0x003C9A6E|Then what was it?
45704|0x003C9A99|Genuine curiosity. Just a simple way of getting to know each other~better. It's only natural to want to learn more about each other,~isn't it?

45733|0x003CA0C7|Yume was smiling.
45734|0x003CA0E8|But it wasn't a joyful, happy kind of smile.
45735|0x003CA11F|But it wasn't a joyful, happy~kind of smile.
45736|0x003CA15B|Instead, I saw this sort of cold, dry emotion there.
45737|0x003CA19A|Instead, I saw this sort of~cold, dry emotion there.
45738|0x003CA1DE|It would be more accurate to describe that emotion on her face as~resignation.

45760|0x003CA97D|You see, there was this boy I used to play with in the past.
45761|0x003CA9C4|You see, there was this boy I~used to play with in the past.
45762|0x003CAA1C|I studied a whole, whole lot 'cause I didn't wanna be outsmarted by~him.
45763|0x003CAA6F|I studied a whole, whole lot~'cause I didn't wanna be~outsmarted by him.
45764|0x003CAAE0|The thing is, that boy was younger than me, yet he was a lot more~knowledgeable about the stars than me...
45765|0x003CAB55|The thing is, that boy was~younger than me, yet he was a~lot more knowledgeable about~the stars than me...
45766|0x003CABDB|Though actually, it wasn't just that. He knew a lot about all sorts of~things.
45767|0x003CAC34|Though actually, it wasn't just~that. He knew a lot about all~sorts of things.
45768|0x003CACAB|So the single thing I was able to teach him was what a kiss was...

45775|0x003CAF36|I just couldn't stand it, so I~studied as much as I could.~It's a funny story.
45776|0x003CAFA0|Eventually, I taught myself enough that I could be the one teaching~him about the stars.
45777|0x003CB003|Eventually, I taught myself~enough that I could be the one~teaching him about the stars.
45778|0x003CB075|Wait, that's...

45788|0x003CB3BB|So even if you ask for a little reunion kiss, you're not getting one~from me.
45789|0x003CB413|So even if you ask for a little~reunion kiss, you're not~getting one from me.

46152|0x003D182A|You should have some too, You-kun.
46153|0x003D1857|You should have some too,~You-kun.
46154|0x003D1893|What about you?
46155|0x003D18AD|What about you?
46156|0x003D18D8|I just ate, actually.
46157|0x003D18F8|I just ate, actually.
46158|0x003D1927|That's fine. You can save some for later then.
46159|0x003D1960|That's fine. You can save some~for later then.
46160|0x003D199E|I placed the bundle on the table.
46161|0x003D19CA|I placed the bundle on the~table.
46162|0x003D1A14|You really don't have to worry about me if you want to have one or~two.
46163|0x003D1A66|You really don't have to worry~about me if you want to have~one or two.
46164|0x003D1AC7|Well, that seems kind of rude. They're meant for you.
46165|0x003D1B07|Well, that seems kind of rude.~They're meant for you.
46166|0x003D1B58|But your girlfriend made those sweets, right?
46167|0x003D1B90|But your girlfriend made those~sweets, right?
46168|0x003D1BD7|...Err, no. Asuho is just a normal friend.
46169|0x003D1C0C|...Err, no. Asuho is just a~normal friend.
46170|0x003D1C52|But there is no reason for you to hold back.
46171|0x003D1C89|But there is no reason for you~to hold back.
46172|0x003D1CC5|What was that supposed to mean?
46173|0x003D1CEF|What was that supposed to mean?
46174|0x003D1D37|Well, it seems you're not a model student just yet then. Maybe I~misjudged you there for a second.
46175|0x003D1DA4|Well, it seems you're not a~model student just yet then.~Maybe I misjudged you there for~a second.
46176|0x003D1E20|What if you did?
46177|0x003D1E3B|What if you did?
46178|0x003D1E67|You'd lose the right to visit me.
46179|0x003D1E93|You'd lose the right to visit~me.
46180|0x003D1ECE|The heck...?
46181|0x003D1EE5|The heck...?
46182|0x003D1F1A|Say, why don't you get yourself a girlfriend? I'm sure it'll be nice.
46183|0x003D1F6A|Say, why don't you get yourself~a girlfriend? I'm sure it'll be~nice.
46184|0x003D1FBF|I was taken aback.
46185|0x003D1FDC|I was taken aback.
46186|0x003D200A|Do you have a crush on any girl in particular?
46187|0x003D2043|Do you have a crush on any girl~in particular?
46188|0x003D208B|...What if I do?
46189|0x003D20A6|...What if I do?
46190|0x003D20D2|You'll gain the right to visit me.
46191|0x003D20FF|You'll gain the right to visit~me.
46192|0x003D213B|I've got a question.
46193|0x003D215A|I've got a question.
46194|0x003D218A|Yes, go right ahead with your question then, sir.
46195|0x003D21C6|Yes, go right ahead with your~question then, sir.
46196|0x003D2211|What if the girl I love happens to be you?
46197|0x003D2246|What if the girl I love happens~to be you?
46198|0x003D22AD|She looked terribly downcast, for some reason.
46199|0x003D22E6|She looked terribly downcast,~for some reason.
46200|0x003D2330|...I'm sure it would lead to something you'd regret.
46201|0x003D236F|...I'm sure it would lead to~something you'd regret.
46202|0x003D23BD|To what, exactly?
46203|0x003D23D9|To what, exactly?
46204|0x003D2406|You'd receive the first failing grade of your life.
46205|0x003D2444|You'd receive the first failing~grade of your life.
46206|0x003D2491|Err, actually, I've already failed a test before.
46207|0x003D24CD|Err, actually, I've already~failed a test before.
46208|0x003D2527|Huh? Seriously?
46209|0x003D2541|Huh? Seriously?
46210|0x003D256A|Yeah.
46211|0x003D257A|Yeah.
46212|0x003D259B|How? You used to be such an eager beaver.
46213|0x003D25CF|How? You used to be such an~eager beaver.
46214|0x003D2612|Well, I guess you could say I've matured.
46215|0x003D2646|Well, I guess you could say~I've matured.
46216|0x003D2698|You stopped being an egghead?
46217|0x003D26C0|You stopped being an egghead?
46218|0x003D26F7|Pretty much, yeah.
46219|0x003D2714|Pretty much, yeah.
46220|0x003D2742|What first comes to mind upon hearing 'the queen of the summer sky'?
46221|0x003D2791|What first comes to mind upon~hearing 'the queen of the~summer sky'?
46222|0x003D27EF|That would be Tanabata's Orihime.
46223|0x003D281B|That would be Tanabata's~Orihime.
46224|0x003D2858|You haven't changed one bit.
46225|0x003D287F|You haven't changed one bit.
46226|0x003D28B5|...Well, I'm just more knowledgeable than the average person when it~comes to Tanabata.
46227|0x003D2917|...Well, I'm just more~knowledgeable than the average~person when it comes to~Tanabata.
46228|0x003D2997|What for?
46229|0x003D29AB|What for?
46230|0x003D29CE|For you.
46231|0x003D29E1|For you.
46232|0x003D2A05|Don't blame it on someone else.
46233|0x003D2A2F|Don't blame it on someone else.
46234|0x003D2A68|...No, uh, I clearly meant it in a positive way.
46235|0x003D2AA3|...No, uh, I clearly meant it~in a positive way.
46236|0x003D2AE3|Starting with Tanabata, I studied up on astronomy because I wanted to~teach Yume about the stars.
46237|0x003D2B4F|Starting with Tanabata, I~studied up on astronomy because~I wanted to teach Yume about~the stars.
46238|0x003D2BC0|But apparently Yume herself also studied them.
46239|0x003D2BF9|But apparently Yume herself~also studied them.
46240|0x003D2C37|Does that mean she had the same goal in mind as me?
46241|0x003D2C75|Does that mean she had the same~goal in mind as me?
46242|0x003D2CD1|A little something about Orihime. Apparently it's actually moving~little by little, and in 12,000 years, she'll take Polaris' place.
46243|0x003D2D60|A little something about~Orihime. Apparently it's~actually moving little by~little, and in 12,000 years,
46244|0x003D2DE4|The idea of Orihime holding the central position in the sky does sound~really nice to me, but I don't know...
46245|0x003D2E5C|The idea of Orihime holding the~central position in the sky~does sound really nice to me,~but I don't know...
46246|0x003D2EE5|At the same time, that means she'll grow further apart from Hikoboshi,~and I imagine it'll make seeing each other a lot more difficult.
46247|0x003D2F77|At the same time, that means~she'll grow further apart from~Hikoboshi, and I imagine it'll~make seeing each other a lot
46248|0x003D3017|Even though Orihime put Hikoboshi on her leash, they'll end up going~their separate ways.
46249|0x003D307B|Even though Orihime put~Hikoboshi on her leash, they'll~end up going their separate~ways.
46250|0x003D30E4|Saying so, she showed me a lonesome smile.
46251|0x003D3119|Saying so, she showed me a~lonesome smile.
46252|0x003D3153|Seeing that sight made pain course through my chest.
46253|0x003D3192|Seeing that sight made pain~course through my chest.
46254|0x003D31E0|...I think you might just be more knowledgeable than me about the~stars now.
46255|0x003D3237|...I think you might just be~more knowledgeable than me~about the stars now.
46256|0x003D3293|On the one hand, it was a tad frustrating, but on the other hand it~also made me happy.
46257|0x003D32F5|On the one hand, it was a tad~frustrating, but on the other~hand it also made me happy.
46258|0x003D3375|Well, studying's still something you can do while living in the~hospital. Not that I study anything school-related, though.
46259|0x003D33FB|Well, studying's still~something you can do while~living in the hospital. Not~that I study anything
46260|0x003D3478|...You had to stop going to school?
46261|0x003D34A6|...You had to stop going to~school?
46262|0x003D34E5|Yep. I pretty much haven't gone to school since about the middle of~elementary school.
46263|0x003D3546|Yep. I pretty much haven't gone~to school since about the~middle of elementary school.
46264|0x003D35AC|Meaning she had already been hospitalized for quite a long time.
46265|0x003D35F7|Meaning she had already been~hospitalized for quite a long~time.
46266|0x003D3647|That fact alone spoke volumes about the nature of Yume's disease.
46267|0x003D3693|That fact alone spoke volumes~about the nature of Yume's~disease.
46268|0x003D36E4|Furthermore, if it was sometime during mid-elementary when she had to~stop, that only makes me wonder how her condition was when we used to~play together.
46269|0x003D3789|Furthermore, if it was sometime~during mid-elementary when she~had to stop, that only makes me~wonder how her condition was
46270|0x003D3814|Back then she seemed perfectly healthy.
46271|0x003D3846|Back then she seemed perfectly~healthy.
46272|0x003D387D|She was able to climb up that hill all by herself. I can hardly~imagine a sickly kid handling that.
46273|0x003D38EB|She was able to climb up that~hill all by herself. I can~hardly imagine a sickly kid~handling that.
46274|0x003D396A|But actually, I didn't even really need school. I had a whole two~personal tutors for myself.
46275|0x003D39D2|But actually, I didn't even~really need school. I had a~whole two personal tutors for~myself.
46276|0x003D3A49|...Really now?
46277|0x003D3A62|...Really now?
46278|0x003D3A8C|Yep. So when I told them I wanted to know more about astronomy, they~both taught me.
46279|0x003D3AEB|Yep. So when I told them I~wanted to know more about~astronomy, they both taught me.
46280|0x003D3B4F|I wanted to know about Yume's disease. I wanted to ask her about it.
46281|0x003D3B9E|I wanted to know about Yume's~disease. I wanted to ask her~about it.
46282|0x003D3BF2|But I couldn't ask.
46283|0x003D3C10|But I couldn't ask.
46284|0x003D3C33|It wasn't the kind of subject I could casually bring up.
46285|0x003D3C76|It wasn't the kind of subject I~could casually bring up.
46286|0x003D3CDF|...What kind of people were these tutors of yours?
46287|0x003D3D1C|...What kind of people were~these tutors of yours?
46288|0x003D3D6A|One of them was my grandmother. She was a pretty formal person, and~really wise too, so I'd always call her Grandmother, even though that~doesn't sound too affectionate.
46289|0x003D3E1E|One of them was my grandmother.~She was a pretty formal person,~and really wise too, so I'd~always call her Grandmother,
46290|0x003D3EBF|She passed away this spring.
46291|0x003D3EE6|She passed away this spring.
46292|0x003D3F12|Yume probably figured that would only make things awkward for me, so~she moved on quickly.
46293|0x003D3F77|Yume probably figured that~would only make things awkward~for me, so she moved on~quickly.
46294|0x003D3FED|So as I was saying, it was my grandmother who taught me all the~beautiful, fantastic constellation myths...
46295|0x003D4063|So as I was saying, it was my~grandmother who taught me all~the beautiful, fantastic~constellation myths...
46296|0x003D40F7|And my fairy friend was the one who taught me all the scientific~stuff.
46297|0x003D4149|And my fairy friend was the one~who taught me all the~scientific stuff.
46298|0x003D41AA|...Your fairy friend?
46299|0x003D41CA|...Your fairy friend?
46300|0x003D4208|Yep. A really pretty fairy, too.
46301|0x003D4233|Yep. A really pretty fairy,~too.
46302|0x003D426F|So pretty you can't even tell whether Fairy is a guy or a woman.
46303|0x003D42BA|So pretty you can't even tell~whether Fairy is a guy or a~woman.
46304|0x003D430A|(Is 'Fairy' this person's nickname or what?)
46305|0x003D4341|(Is 'Fairy' this person's~nickname or what?)
46306|0x003D4396|It was here in Hibarigasaki that I got to know my fairy friend, and~she still comes here pretty often. She's really smart, in a different~way than my grandma.
46307|0x003D443F|It was here in Hibarigasaki~that I got to know my fairy~friend, and she still comes~here pretty often. She's really
46308|0x003D44CC|Huh? I thought you said I was the first visitor you've had here?
46309|0x003D4517|Huh? I thought you said I was~the first visitor you've had~here?
46310|0x003D4573|Well, in Fairy's case, it's more like a tutoring session, so I don't~count it.
46311|0x003D45CC|Well, in Fairy's case, it's~more like a tutoring session,~so I don't count it.
46312|0x003D4634|And you study together with this person?

46314|0x003D46AB|Yep.
46315|0x003D46BA|Yep.
46316|0x003D46D8|I'd kinda like to meet that person, too, some time.
46317|0x003D4716|I'd kinda like to meet that~person, too, some time.
46318|0x003D4765|Well, Fairy can only meet a select few people, so it might be a bit~difficult.
46319|0x003D47BE|Well, Fairy can only meet a~select few people, so it might~be a bit difficult.
46320|0x003D481C|I could only tilt my head questioningly at that.
46321|0x003D4857|I could only tilt my head~questioningly at that.
46322|0x003D48C8|Just before leaving, I asked her...

46324|0x003D4965|Can I... come again?

46327|0x003D49E5|Sure, if you want.
46328|0x003D4A07|Not a moment's hesitation.
46329|0x003D4A2C|Not a moment's hesitation.
46330|0x003D4A70|I still believe you'll become that model student one day, after all.
46331|0x003D4ABF|I still believe you'll become~that model student one day,~after all.
46332|0x003D4B13|If that means she won't reject me, I would gladly become a model~student or do whatever else she wants me to.
46333|0x003D4B8B|If that means she won't reject~me, I would gladly become a~model student or do whatever~else she wants me to.
46334|0x003D4C12|Is the same time as today all right?
46335|0x003D4C41|Is the same time as today all~right?
46336|0x003D4C8F|Any time is fine. Since well, as you know, I'm under house arrest~here.
46337|0x003D4CE1|Any time is fine. Since well,~as you know, I'm under house~arrest here.
46338|0x003D4D52|Ah, but you should know that I'll be out whenever I have examinations~some place else.
46339|0x003D4DB3|Ah, but you should know that~I'll be out whenever I have~examinations some place else.
46340|0x003D4E19|I guess by some place else, she just meant outside this room.
46341|0x003D4E61|I guess by some place else, she~just meant outside this room.
46342|0x003D4EC8|So if I'm ever not here when you come, you can just wait for me. They~don't take too long anyway.
46343|0x003D4F34|So if I'm ever not here when~you come, you can just wait for~me. They don't take too long~anyway.
46344|0x003D4FAF|Okay, I'll do that.

46357|0x003D530C|I put the hospital room behind~me, with Yume waving me goodbye~from her bed.
46358|0x003D53A8|The Yume I'd been talking to was the Yume I knew. There was no doubt~in my mind now.

46360|0x003D546B|On the one hand, I felt relief at that, but on the other hand it made~me wonder why she insisted on hiding it.
46361|0x003D54E4|On the one hand, I felt relief~at that, but on the other hand~it made me wonder why she~insisted on hiding it.
46362|0x003D5581|It made me anxious when I tried to think of why she was pretending to~forget.
46363|0x003D55D9|It made me anxious when I tried~to think of why she was~pretending to forget.
46364|0x003D5636|As I walked out the hospital, I felt a sting on my eyes from the~sunset's intensity.
46365|0x003D5695|As I walked out the hospital, I~felt a sting on my eyes from~the sunset's intensity.
46366|0x003D57A5|...Senpai.

46368|0x003D57D4|After dinner, unusually enough, Aoi-san came up to me.
46369|0x003D5815|After dinner, unusually enough,~Aoi-san came up to me.
46370|0x003D5865|What's wrong?
46371|0x003D587D|What's wrong?
46372|0x003D58B4|You skipped out on the club today, didn't you?
46373|0x003D58ED|You skipped out on the club~today, didn't you?
46374|0x003D5935|...I didn't even realize it, but yeah, I guess I did.
46375|0x003D5975|...I didn't even realize it,~but yeah, I guess I did.
46376|0x003D59BA|I was so occupied with visiting Yume that I totally forgot about the~club.
46377|0x003D5A0F|I was so occupied with visiting~Yume that I totally forgot~about the club.
46378|0x003D5A69|However, neither Asuho nor Kosame-san touched upon it.

46380|0x003D5AF0|They probably intentionally avoided the topic.

46382|0x003D5BA3|Onii-chan, did you skip so you could go see Yume-san?
46383|0x003D5BE3|Onii-chan, did you skip so you~could go see Yume-san?
46384|0x003D5C32|You could say that.

46396|0x003D60DA|Well a first love is a first love precisely because it never came to~anything! Rather than carrying on with that pointless struggle I for~one think you should shift your affections to a more closer achievable~person!

46560|0x003D8D49|But they don't reap the nightmares of other shinigami.
46561|0x003D8D8A|But they don't reap the~nightmares of other shinigami.
46562|0x003D8DDA|That's because shinigami possess something even more important than~these simple dreams.
46563|0x003D8E3D|That's because shinigami~possess something even more~important than these simple~dreams.

46634|0x003DA325|I can only imagine what Yume would think upon seeing Mare.

46636|0x003DA3B4|And vice-versa.
46637|0x003DA3CE|And vice-versa.
46638|0x003DA3ED|Or maybe the two of them are actually already acquainted?
46639|0x003DA431|Or maybe the two of them are~actually already acquainted?
46640|0x003DA47A|I'd have to muster up a lot of courage to confirm that.

46642|0x003DA57D|You really love looking out the window, huh?
46643|0x003DA5B4|You really love looking out the~window, huh?
46644|0x003DA616|Upon entering the room, I once again found Yume standing by the window~and gazing outside.
46645|0x003DA67B|Upon entering the room, I once~again found Yume standing by~the window and gazing outside.
46646|0x003DA706|I really love the outside in general. You have such a nice view of the~sky.

46648|0x003DA7C1|You love the starry sky, don't you?

46650|0x003DA83C|Not just the starry sky. I also love the daytime sky.
46651|0x003DA87C|Not just the starry sky. I also~love the daytime sky.
46652|0x003DA8DB|If I were a bird, you know, I think I'd be flying around the skies all~day and all night.

46658|0x003DAB4E|Hm, really?
46659|0x003DAB64|Hm, really?
46660|0x003DAB89|Totally.
46661|0x003DAB9C|Totally.
46662|0x003DABCE|Do I seem like a sheltered, rich girl that always dreams of being free~one day?
46663|0x003DAC28|Do I seem like a sheltered,~rich girl that always dreams of~being free one day?
46664|0x003DAC91|Maybe if your personality was a bit more ladylike.

46670|0x003DADE6|What?
46671|0x003DADF6|What?
46672|0x003DAE24|I know I said you could come whenever, but do you really have to come~everyday? Isn't that a hassle for you?
46673|0x003DAE9B|I know I said you could come~whenever, but do you really~have to come everyday? Isn't~that a hassle for you?
46674|0x003DAF21|Not at all.
46675|0x003DAF37|Not at all.
46676|0x003DAF5E|Don't you have other things to do?
46677|0x003DAF8B|Don't you have other things to~do?
46678|0x003DAFC7|...Nope.
46679|0x003DAFDA|...Nope.
46680|0x003DAFFE|Are you actually lying to me, Mister?
46681|0x003DB02E|Are you actually lying to me,~Mister?
46682|0x003DB06D|I'd never lie to you.
46683|0x003DB08D|I'd never lie to you.
46684|0x003DB0BE|Are you actually taking time away from other things to visit me?

46686|0x003DB163|No, I promise I'm not.
46687|0x003DB184|No, I promise I'm not.
46688|0x003DB1C3|Well, if you are, I'll ban you from visiting me. Just so we're clear.
46689|0x003DB213|Well, if you are, I'll ban you~from visiting me. Just so we're~clear.
46690|0x003DB272|...Why?
46691|0x003DB284|...Why?
46692|0x003DB2A7|Just because.
46693|0x003DB2BF|Just because.
46694|0x003DB2DC|I could only nod.
46695|0x003DB2F8|I could only nod.
46696|0x003DB323|You said I was your first visitor since you've come to Hibarigasaki,~right?
46697|0x003DB379|You said I was your first~visitor since you've come to~Hibarigasaki, right?
46698|0x003DB3ED|It may seem strange, but yeah. It's only been three months since I~came here.
46699|0x003DB445|It may seem strange, but yeah.~It's only been three months~since I came here.
46700|0x003DB4AC|All your friends and family are back there?
46701|0x003DB4E2|All your friends and family are~back there?
46702|0x003DB529|Yeah, for the most part.
46703|0x003DB54C|Yeah, for the most part.
46704|0x003DB57E|So why'd you come back to Hibarigasaki in the first place?
46705|0x003DB5C3|So why'd you come back to~Hibarigasaki in the first~place?
46706|0x003DB626|I have to correct you there. This is my first time in Hibarigasaki.
46707|0x003DB674|I have to correct you there.~This is my first time in~Hibarigasaki.
46708|0x003DB6D1|...You're still going on with that?
46709|0x003DB6FF|...You're still going on with~that?
46710|0x003DB74B|And I don't plan to change it.
46711|0x003DB774|And I don't plan to change it.
46712|0x003DB7AC|...Oh well, let's just go with that for now.
46713|0x003DB7E3|...Oh well, let's just go with~that for now.
46714|0x003DB82B|Not for now. It'll always stay that way.
46715|0x003DB85E|Not for now. It'll always stay~that way.
46716|0x003DB896|Her stubbornness hadn't changed since back then either.
46717|0x003DB8D8|Her stubbornness hadn't changed~since back then either.
46718|0x003DB929|So what made you move to Hibarigasaki?
46719|0x003DB95A|So what made you move to~Hibarigasaki?
46720|0x003DB99C|Well, this is my grandmother's hometown.
46721|0x003DB9CF|Well, this is my grandmother's~hometown.
46722|0x003DBA11|Yeah, and you said she was tutoring you.
46723|0x003DBA44|Yeah, and you said she was~tutoring you.
46724|0x003DBA95|Right. Something like hospital school seemed boring to me, so I had my~grandmother help me study instead.
46725|0x003DBB09|Right. Something like hospital~school seemed boring to me, so~I had my grandmother help me~study instead.
46726|0x003DBB8E|She taught me a lot of stuff they wouldn't teach you in school, too.
46727|0x003DBBDD|She taught me a lot of stuff~they wouldn't teach you in~school, too.
46728|0x003DBC4A|But eventually she passed away this spring, and after the ensuing~muddle had settled down, I decided I'd come back here to Hibarigasaki.
46729|0x003DBCDD|But eventually she passed away~this spring, and after the~ensuing muddle had settled~down, I decided I'd come back
46730|0x003DBD69|You just said 'come back', didn't you?
46731|0x003DBD9A|You just said 'come back',~didn't you?
46732|0x003DBDE9|If you keep being a bad boy, I'll have to ban you from visiting me.
46733|0x003DBE37|If you keep being a bad boy,~I'll have to ban you from~visiting me.
46734|0x003DBE94|...Sorry. I won't interject anymore.
46735|0x003DBEC3|...Sorry. I won't interject~anymore.
46736|0x003DBF10|So like I was saying, I spent a long time in a different city.
46737|0x003DBF59|So like I was saying, I spent a~long time in a different city.
46738|0x003DBFB3|I might have had some friends back here in Hibarigasaki, but I doubt~they remember me anymore.
46739|0x003DC01C|I might have had some friends~back here in Hibarigasaki, but~I doubt they remember me~anymore.
46740|0x003DC094|That's not true.
46741|0x003DC0AF|That's not true.
46742|0x003DC0E8|How can you be so sure?
46743|0x003DC10A|How can you be so sure?
46744|0x003DC13B|Well...
46745|0x003DC14D|Well...
46746|0x003DC164|Because I never forgot her.
46747|0x003DC18A|Because I never forgot her.
46748|0x003DC1B5|Although I forgot her name once, I recovered that as well.
46749|0x003DC1FA|Although I forgot her name~once, I recovered that as well.
46750|0x003DC244|Not even for a second did I ever forget that I knew the girl named~Yume.
46751|0x003DC297|Not even for a second did I~ever forget that I knew the~girl named Yume.
46752|0x003DC2EF|Although I refrained from saying that, since I didn't want to get~banned.
46753|0x003DC343|Although I refrained from~saying that, since I didn't~want to get banned.
46754|0x003DC3A6|...That fairy person still comes to see you, right?
46755|0x003DC3E4|...That fairy person still~comes to see you, right?
46756|0x003DC440|True. But I got to know that person after coming here. We're not long~time friends or anything.
46757|0x003DC4AA|True. But I got to know that~person after coming here. We're~not long time friends or~anything.
46758|0x003DC523|You said that person also tutors you, if I remember correctly.
46759|0x003DC56C|You said that person also~tutors you, if I remember~correctly.
46760|0x003DC5D3|Yep. We don't look too far apart age-wise, so I guess you might also~say we're friends.
46761|0x003DC635|Yep. We don't look too far~apart age-wise, so I guess you~might also say we're friends.
46762|0x003DC6A8|Incidentally, Fairy dropped by after you left yesterday.
46763|0x003DC6EB|Incidentally, Fairy dropped by~after you left yesterday.
46764|0x003DC73D|That person knows a lot about astronomy, right?
46765|0x003DC777|That person knows a lot about~astronomy, right?
46766|0x003DC7C2|Yep.
46767|0x003DC7D1|Yep.
46768|0x003DC7EF|What kind of things do they teach you?
46769|0x003DC820|What kind of things do they~teach you?
46770|0x003DC88F|Well, this is a neat one. Did you know that we humans were born from~the stars? Fairy told me that once.
46771|0x003DC902|Well, this is a neat one. Did~you know that we humans were~born from the stars? Fairy told~me that once.
46772|0x003DC97A|I tilted my head curiously.
46773|0x003DC9A0|I tilted my head curiously.
46774|0x003DC9D5|Is that supposed to be talking about how we technically exist because~of our sun, which is a star? That seems fairly obvious, actually.
46775|0x003DCA67|Is that supposed to be talking~about how we technically exist~because of our sun, which is a~star? That seems fairly
46776|0x003DCAF7|Hmm, well it's more like this. The stuff our bodies are made up of~used to be part of the stars of our universe once upon a time.
46777|0x003DCB83|Hmm, well it's more like this.~The stuff our bodies are made~up of used to be part of the~stars of our universe once upon
46778|0x003DCC18|And shortly after our planet, Earth, was formed, there was a period~where it was hit constantly by meteorites, which is what we owe our~existence to.
46779|0x003DCCB8|And shortly after our planet,~Earth, was formed, there was a~period where it was hit~constantly by meteorites, which
46780|0x003DCD48|Each of us has a star that once existed that we call our home.
46781|0x003DCD91|Each of us has a star that once~existed that we call our home.
46782|0x003DCDE9|...Sounds like something out of a fantasy novel.
46783|0x003DCE24|...Sounds like something out of~a fantasy novel.
46784|0x003DCE70|It's supported by science, too, neatly enough. All the astronomers~worked really hard for years, and they finally found evidence.
46785|0x003DCEFC|It's supported by science, too,~neatly enough. All the~astronomers worked really hard~for years, and they finally
46786|0x003DCF89|For us here on Earth, the stars are out of reach. The only thing we~can do is study them through what we see.
46787|0x003DD001|For us here on Earth, the stars~are out of reach. The only~thing we can do is study them~through what we see.
46788|0x003DD08A|But luckily for us, the stars send us their light, and we receive that~light. It's almost like they're sending us messages, you know?
46789|0x003DD11A|But luckily for us, the stars~send us their light, and we~receive that light. It's almost~like they're sending us
46790|0x003DD1A7|Scientifically speaking, we call those electromagnetic waves.
46791|0x003DD1EF|Scientifically speaking, we~call those electromagnetic~waves.
46792|0x003DD248|Some day we'll be able to learn about the places we came from through~those.
46793|0x003DD29F|Some day we'll be able to learn~about the places we came from~through those.
46794|0x003DD305|Sounds like something out of a science fiction story.
46795|0x003DD345|Sounds like something out of a~science fiction story.
46796|0x003DD396|Apparently, it's perfectly plausible according to modern astrophysics.
46797|0x003DD3E7|Apparently, it's perfectly~plausible according to modern~astrophysics.
46798|0x003DD447|Though even if we do find the star we came from, wouldn't that star~already be long gone by now?
46799|0x003DD4B2|Though even if we do find the~star we came from, wouldn't~that star already be long gone~by now?
46800|0x003DD53B|You're right. It takes the light from stars a long, long time to reach~us. The messages we receive could be from hundreds of million years~ago.
46801|0x003DD5D5|You're right. It takes the~light from stars a long, long~time to reach us. The messages~we receive could be from
46802|0x003DD661|The star we came from could've very easily gone out during that time.
46803|0x003DD6B1|The star we came from could've~very easily gone out during~that time.
46804|0x003DD71F|But still, even if our birthplace is gone, other birthplaces might~still be there.
46805|0x003DD77C|But still, even if our~birthplace is gone, other~birthplaces might still be~there.
46806|0x003DD7EA|The places that beings other than us call their birthplaces.
46807|0x003DD831|The places that beings other~than us call their birthplaces.
46808|0x003DD889|Since, well, meteorites are still falling to this day.
46809|0x003DD8CA|Since, well, meteorites are~still falling to this day.
46810|0x003DD91C|Among these meteorites, you also have some that contain materials~never before found here on Earth.
46811|0x003DD98A|Among these meteorites, you~also have some that contain~materials never before found~here on Earth.
46812|0x003DDA16|Different meteorites from those ancient ones that gave birth to us...
46813|0x003DDA66|Different meteorites from those~ancient ones that gave birth to~us...
46814|0x003DDAF5|Those birthplaces might still be delivering new life to this planet.
46815|0x003DDB44|Those birthplaces might still~be delivering new life to this~planet.
46816|0x003DDC41|Hey, hey, Onii-chan!! You'll never ever never ever believe it,~Onii-chan!!
46817|0x003DDC96|Hey, hey, Onii-chan!! You'll~never ever never ever believe~it, Onii-chan!!

46840|0x003DE429|...Ditto.
46841|0x003DE43D|...Ditto.
46842|0x003DE48B|Fairy always shows up in the wee hours of the night, so you guys~haven't met her! She always says that I'm just dreaming, and then she~just like vanishes into thin air!

47084|0x003E2F5A|How's the lookout now?
47085|0x003E2F7B|How's the lookout now?
47086|0x003E2FAB|Just like it used to be. Nothing's changed there.
47087|0x003E2FE7|Just like it used to be.~Nothing's changed there.

47098|0x003E346F|Talk with the stars? I think you mean observe.
47099|0x003E34A8|Talk with the stars? I think~you mean observe.
47100|0x003E34FF|Nope, I meant what I said. The starlight is a form of message, which~allows us to talk with the stars through our telescopes.

47105|0x003E3760|Well, of course. We do that~just fine.
47106|0x003E37A2|We're perfectly capable of sending our own messages to the stars,~didn't you know?
47107|0x003E37FF|We're perfectly capable of~sending our own messages to the~stars, didn't you know?

47134|0x003E4001|......
47135|0x003E4012|......
47136|0x003E4034|The fact that you can take photos of scenery even in the middle of the~night using infrared photography is proof of that. Though all of this~is just stuff I'm reiterating from what my fairy friend told me.

47144|0x003E42EF|Apparently, in another thirty years or so, it'll be possible to~discover planets just like Earth due to the advancement of telescope~technology. So it might be within our lifetimes that they discover~aliens. Isn't that cool?

47580|0x003EC774|She turned to look at me, with her hand resting on the window.
47581|0x003EC7BD|She turned to look at me, with~her hand resting on the window.
47582|0x003EC825|Well, what about you, Mister? You're quite a bit later than usual.~Something happen?
47583|0x003EC884|Well, what about you, Mister?~You're quite a bit later than~usual. Something happen?
47584|0x003EC8F2|Yeah, I kind of experienced something a little... interesting.
47585|0x003EC93B|Yeah, I kind of experienced~something a little...~interesting.
47586|0x003EC9A3|Did you meet your first love?
47587|0x003EC9CB|Did you meet your first love?
47588|0x003ECA02|...No.
47589|0x003ECA13|...No.
47590|0x003ECA29|It was funny to hear her asking me that, when I suspected she herself~was my first love.
47591|0x003ECA8C|It was funny to hear her asking~me that, when I suspected she~herself was my first love.
47592|0x003ECAF4|All my friends really seemed to think so, since they enjoyed teasing~me about it so much.
47593|0x003ECB58|All my friends really seemed to~think so, since they enjoyed~teasing me about it so much.
47594|0x003ECBC1|As for myself, I was still not quite sure if she was or not.
47595|0x003ECC08|As for myself, I was still not~quite sure if she was or not.
47596|0x003ECC54|And if she wasn't my first love, then that would mean I hadn't~experienced my first love at all yet.
47597|0x003ECCC3|And if she wasn't my first~love, then that would mean I~hadn't experienced my first~love at all yet.
47598|0x003ECD51|Do you want something? You're kind of staring at me.
47599|0x003ECD90|Do you want something? You're~kind of staring at me.
47600|0x003ECDDE|...Oh no, it's nothing. The person I ran into before coming here told~me to tell you to get better soon.
47601|0x003ECE51|...Oh no, it's nothing. The~person I ran into before coming~here told me to tell you to get~better soon.
47602|0x003ECEE3|Oh, why thanks. A friend of yours, is it?
47603|0x003ECF17|Oh, why thanks. A friend of~yours, is it?
47604|0x003ECF5A|Well, yeah.
47605|0x003ECF70|Well, yeah.
47606|0x003ECFA5|......
47607|0x003ECFB6|......
47608|0x003ECFD6|Why the stare?
47609|0x003ECFEF|Why the stare?
47610|0x003ED027|I think you should be asking yourself that question first, Mister. I~can hardly appreciate how intently you are staring at a girl in her~pajamas.
47611|0x003ED0C3|I think you should be asking~yourself that question first,~Mister. I can hardly appreciate~how intently you are staring at
47612|0x003ED157|...You're always in your pajamas though.
47613|0x003ED18A|...You're always in your~pajamas though.
47614|0x003ED1DC|Well, still.
47615|0x003ED1F3|Well, still.
47616|0x003ED222|Yume giggled and returned to her bed.
47617|0x003ED252|Yume giggled and returned to~her bed.
47618|0x003ED287|I sighed and sat down in one of the chairs.
47619|0x003ED2BD|I sighed and sat down in one of~the chairs.
47620|0x003ED32E|I remember last time you said you've been stargazing here in~Hibarigasaki.
47621|0x003ED383|I remember last time you said~you've been stargazing here in~Hibarigasaki.
47622|0x003ED3E7|Yeah. I'm part the school's Astro Club.

47634|0x003ED69B|You must really love the stars.

47636|0x003ED6FE|All thanks to you, Yume.
47637|0x003ED721|All thanks to you, Yume.
47638|0x003ED755|Is that so?
47639|0x003ED76B|Is that so?
47640|0x003ED790|Yeah, since you and I played together at the lookout so much.
47641|0x003ED7D8|Yeah, since you and I played~together at the lookout so~much.
47642|0x003ED831|Correction: not me, but the girl from your memories.
47643|0x003ED870|Correction: not me, but the~girl from your memories.
47644|0x003ED8BE|You really are adamant about not admitting that, aren't you?
47645|0x003ED905|You really are adamant about~not admitting that, aren't you?
47646|0x003ED95D|And I never will. Nope, not ever.
47647|0x003ED989|And I never will. Nope, not~ever.
47648|0x003ED9BA|I didn't want to argue about it, so I dropped the subject.
47649|0x003ED9FF|I didn't want to argue about~it, so I dropped the subject.
47650|0x003EDA55|Do you have fun in your club?

47659|0x003EDBC9|That's good to hear.
47660|0x003EDBED|She smiled cheerfully.
47661|0x003EDC0E|She smiled cheerfully.
47662|0x003EDC3A|Her attitude was in some ways the opposite of the Yume in my memories,~but in other ways her attitude was exactly the same.
47663|0x003EDCC0|Her attitude was in some ways~the opposite of the Yume in my~memories, but in other ways her~attitude was exactly the same.
47664|0x003EDDC5|You-kun, who's calling you a model student?
47665|0x003EDDFB|You-kun, who's calling you a~model student?
47666|0x003EDE40|My homeroom teacher.
47667|0x003EDE5F|My homeroom teacher.
47668|0x003EDE9D|That teacher's the root of all evil, I guarantee you.
47669|0x003EDEDD|That teacher's the root of all~evil, I guarantee you.
47670|0x003EDF2C|...No way. He's a really nice person.
47671|0x003EDF5C|...No way. He's a really nice~person.
47672|0x003EDFAB|That's what he wants you to believe. And you're completely taking his~bait.
47673|0x003EE001|That's what he wants you to~believe. And you're completely~taking his bait.
47674|0x003EE066|...I just can't see that being true.
47675|0x003EE095|...I just can't see that being~true.
47676|0x003EE0E3|Pull yourself together, You-kun. You gotta be extra careful not to~take any of that teacher's cajolery as truth.
47677|0x003EE15E|Pull yourself together,~You-kun. You gotta be extra~careful not to take any of that~teacher's cajolery as truth.
47678|0x003EE1E8|...Why are you making him sound like the bad guy?
47679|0x003EE224|...Why are you making him sound~like the bad guy?
47680|0x003EE27F|...All teachers are that way.
47681|0x003EE2A7|...All teachers are that way.
47682|0x003EE2E0|That's just how school is...
47683|0x003EE307|That's just how school is...
47684|0x003EE33D|Do you not like school?
47685|0x003EE35F|Do you not like school?
47686|0x003EE3A0|......

47688|0x003EE3FE|You-kun.
47689|0x003EE411|You-kun.
47690|0x003EE429|Hearing my name being called, my consciousness was pulled back to~reality.
47691|0x003EE47E|Hearing my name being called,~my consciousness was pulled~back to reality.
47692|0x003EE4F1|How was life in the city?
47693|0x003EE515|How was life in the city?
47694|0x003EE548|...Huh?
47695|0x003EE55A|...Huh?
47696|0x003EE57D|Well, I just wonder if you were in an Astronomy Club at your old~school, too.
47697|0x003EE5D5|Well, I just wonder if you were~in an Astronomy Club at your~old school, too.
47698|0x003EE63C|No, this one is my first one.
47699|0x003EE664|No, this one is my first one.
47700|0x003EE69D|Okay, okay. Back to my original question then. It seems like you're~doing stargazing here in Hibarigasaki, but...
47701|0x003EE719|Okay, okay. Back to my original~question then. It seems like~you're doing stargazing here in~Hibarigasaki, but...
47702|0x003EE7A6|Were you doing that in the city, too?
47703|0x003EE7D6|Were you doing that in the~city, too?
47704|0x003EE815|Hrm...
47705|0x003EE826|Hrm...
47706|0x003EE83C|I thought back upon my past self.
47707|0x003EE868|I thought back upon my past~self.
47708|0x003EE8A3|Back there, yeah, I think I did look up at the night sky every once in~a while.
47709|0x003EE8FD|Back there, yeah, I think I did~look up at the night sky every~once in a while.
47710|0x003EE975|How was it?
47711|0x003EE98B|How was it?
47712|0x003EE9B0|Honestly, pretty uninspiring.
47713|0x003EE9D8|Honestly, pretty uninspiring.
47714|0x003EEA1E|I figured you'd say that.
47715|0x003EEA42|I figured you'd say that.
47716|0x003EEA6B|Yume nodded.
47717|0x003EEA82|Yume nodded.
47718|0x003EEAAA|You know, I once tried out astrophotography with my grandmother.
47719|0x003EEAF5|You know, I once tried out~astrophotography with my~grandmother.
47720|0x003EEB51|That was on the hospital's rooftop. I borrowed a telescope and camera~from her, and she went up there with me and told me what to do.
47721|0x003EEBE1|That was on the hospital's~rooftop. I borrowed a telescope~and camera from her, and she~went up there with me and told
47722|0x003EEC73|But I only got a measly two stars to show up on my picture.
47723|0x003EECB9|But I only got a measly two~stars to show up on my picture.
47724|0x003EED10|Just Orihime and Hikoboshi. The other stars should've been shining~bright up in the sky too, but for whatever reason I just couldn't~capture them.
47725|0x003EEDAD|Just Orihime and Hikoboshi. The~other stars should've been~shining bright up in the sky~too, but for whatever reason I
47726|0x003EEE3F|More than likely what was causing it was the light pollution.
47727|0x003EEE87|More than likely what was~causing it was the light~pollution.
47728|0x003EEED4|Even if the night sky is clear in the city, neon light and smog dim~out the stars.
47729|0x003EEF31|Even if the night sky is clear~in the city, neon light and~smog dim out the stars.
47730|0x003EEF93|Unless the stars are shining as brightly as Orihime or Hikoboshi, you~can't perceive them.
47731|0x003EEFF8|Unless the stars are shining as~brightly as Orihime or~Hikoboshi, you can't perceive~them.
47732|0x003EF062|There are a multitude of stars visible in Hibarigasaki that I couldn't~see in the city.
47733|0x003EF0C4|There are a multitude of stars~visible in Hibarigasaki that I~couldn't see in the city.
47734|0x003EF144|What's more, the pictures came out a deep blue despite them being~taken at night.
47735|0x003EF1A0|What's more, the pictures came~out a deep blue despite them~being taken at night.
47736|0x003EF20D|Grandmother said that was probably due to light pollution, too, but I~don't know...
47737|0x003EF26B|Grandmother said that was~probably due to light~pollution, too, but I don't~know...
47738|0x003EF2E7|At the time, I just kinda thought that the city's night sky resembled~Hibarigasaki's blue sky.
47739|0x003EF350|At the time, I just kinda~thought that the city's night~sky resembled Hibarigasaki's~blue sky.
47740|0x003EF3CA|So, thinking of it like that, I brought myself to like the city sky.
47741|0x003EF419|So, thinking of it like that, I~brought myself to like the city~sky.
47742|0x003EF477|It's all a matter of perspective, basically.
47743|0x003EF4AE|It's all a matter of~perspective, basically.
47744|0x003EF4F6|Yep. Though you can't see any shooting stars there, so that at least~kinda bummed me out.
47745|0x003EF55A|Yep. Though you can't see any~shooting stars there, so that~at least kinda bummed me out.
47746|0x003EF5CD|Did you want to make a wish?
47747|0x003EF5F4|Did you want to make a wish?
47748|0x003EF639|...Maybe.
47749|0x003EF64D|...Maybe.
47750|0x003EF666|Yume made a troubled face, as if thinking about something difficult.
47751|0x003EF6B5|Yume made a troubled face, as~if thinking about something~difficult.
47752|0x003EF715|But, actually, I'd already wished upon one before.
47753|0x003EF752|But, actually, I'd already~wished upon one before.
47754|0x003EF7A0|I think the Star God would have a hard time with multiple wishes from~one person, so I told myself just one was enough.
47755|0x003EF822|I think the Star God would have~a hard time with multiple~wishes from one person, so I~told myself just one was
47756|0x003EF8AB|Say, Yume.
47757|0x003EF8C0|Say, Yume.
47758|0x003EF8E7|Yume's expression returned to normal as she waited for my next words.
47759|0x003EF937|Yume's expression returned to~normal as she waited for my~next words.
47760|0x003EF996|You said you wished upon a shooting star once before. When exactly was~that?
47761|0x003EF9ED|You said you wished upon a~shooting star once before. When~exactly was that?
47762|0x003EFA55|Well, uh, that's a secret.
47763|0x003EFA7A|Well, uh, that's a secret.
47764|0x003EFAAE|What did you wish for?
47765|0x003EFACF|What did you wish for?
47766|0x003EFB0E|That's also a secret.
47767|0x003EFB2E|That's also a secret.
47768|0x003EFB5F|If I tell you, the effect will become null, so I'd lose my wish. I~definitely don't want that.
47769|0x003EFBC8|If I tell you, the effect will~become null, so I'd lose my~wish. I definitely don't want~that.
47770|0x003EFC36|When you make a wish upon a shooting star, your wish comes true.
47771|0x003EFC81|When you make a wish upon a~shooting star, your wish comes~true.
47772|0x003EFCD1|I wonder if Yume truly believes in that power.
47773|0x003EFD0A|I wonder if Yume truly believes~in that power.
47774|0x003EFD48|I wonder if I did, too, as a young boy.
47775|0x003EFD7A|I wonder if I did, too, as a~young boy.
47776|0x003EFDCA|Fun fact, comets used to be thought of as a bad omen. They were~referred to as unlucky stars.
47777|0x003EFE32|Fun fact, comets used to be~thought of as a bad omen. They~were referred to as unlucky~stars.
47778|0x003EFEAB|On the other hand, shooting stars just might be the opposite, they~might be lodging something like hope which lets them make your wish~come true.
47779|0x003EFF47|On the other hand, shooting~stars just might be the~opposite, they might be lodging~something like hope which lets
47780|0x003EFFE2|Maybe they carry that sort of light deep within, you know?
47781|0x003F0027|Maybe they carry that sort of~light deep within, you know?
47782|0x003F00EE|Have you ever made a wish upon a shooting star, Mare?
47783|0x003F012E|Have you ever made a wish upon~a shooting star, Mare?
47784|0x003F01A5|A wish?
47785|0x003F01B7|A wish?
47786|0x003F01D8|They say that when you make a wish upon a shooting star, that wish~will come true.
47787|0x003F0235|They say that when you make a~wish upon a shooting star, that~wish will come true.
47788|0x003F02A1|Uh-huh.
47789|0x003F02B3|Uh-huh.
47790|0x003F02D4|So I guess that means you haven't?
47791|0x003F0301|So I guess that means you~haven't?
47792|0x003F0348|Got a problem with that?
47793|0x003F036B|Got a problem with that?
47794|0x003F039D|No, that's fine. But wouldn't you want to make a wish given the~chance?
47795|0x003F03EF|No, that's fine. But wouldn't~you want to make a wish given~the chance?
47796|0x003F0450|Nope.
47797|0x003F0460|Nope.
47798|0x003F047F|Why not?
47799|0x003F0492|Why not?
47800|0x003F04BF|That stuff's just superstition. There's no way my wish would actually~come true.
47801|0x003F051A|That stuff's just superstition.~There's no way my wish would~actually come true.
47802|0x003F057A|I smiled wryly.
47803|0x003F0594|I smiled wryly.
47804|0x003F05B3|I'm positive that I used to think that very same thing as a kid.
47805|0x003F05FE|I'm positive that I used to~think that very same thing as a~kid.
47806|0x003F064E|Yet despite that, I did in fact make a wish.
47807|0x003F0685|Yet despite that, I did in fact~make a wish.
47808|0x003F06C1|I thought that wish could still come true, even though I had no~business having that wish granted.
47809|0x003F072E|I thought that wish could still~come true, even though I had no~business having that wish~granted.
47810|0x003F07A0|I wanted to cling to that minuscule, almost non-existent possibility,~so I sent my wish up to the sky.
47811|0x003F0811|I wanted to cling to that~minuscule, almost non-existent~possibility, so I sent my wish~up to the sky.
47812|0x003F0887|I sent that wish up to the night sky ? or maybe it was evening at the~time.
47813|0x003F08DD|I sent that wish up to the~night sky ? or maybe it was~evening at the time.
47814|0x003F0938|Regardless, on that day, I wished upon it ─ the first star to~appear.
47815|0x003F0989|Regardless, on that day, I~wished upon it ─ the first~star to appear.
47816|0x003F09DF|As that shooting star streaked across the sky for what felt like an~eternity, I prayed to it.
47817|0x003F0A47|As that shooting star streaked~across the sky for what felt~like an eternity, I prayed to~it.
47818|0x003F0B06|...Mare.
47819|0x003F0B19|...Mare.
47820|0x003F0B58|Don't you have a wish, or just anything in general you want?
47821|0x003F0B9F|Don't you have a wish, or just~anything in general you want?

47828|0x003F0CEE|Maybe, yeah.

48089|0x003F5752|Something hard to say?
48090|0x003F5782|It's just something that requires a little bit of courage.
48091|0x003F57C7|It's just something that~requires a little bit of~courage.

48106|0x003F5C25|She was expecting him to come soon.
48107|0x003F5C53|She was expecting him to come~soon.
48108|0x003F5CB2|Since You-kun always shows up come night, she had become intuitively~able to approximate the time he would arrive.

48121|0x003F60C9|He regained the memory Mare~reaped from him for sure.

48123|0x003F6156|Not only that, but apparently,~he had even reunited with her.
48124|0x003F61A3|Since Yume was hospitalized, You had started going to visit her every~day.
48125|0x003F61F8|Since Yume was hospitalized,~You had started going to visit~her every day.

48141|0x003F6639|Mare couldn't help but wonder~whether this situation was~going against her promise with~Yume.

48151|0x003F6973|It turns into a painful~experience for her every time.
48152|0x003F69B9|Every time she does it, her chest hurts, and her eyes start to fill~with tears, and then ultimately she ends up crying.

48318|0x003F9AA8|I'm not nearly weak enough that I'd need a kid like you to protect me.
48319|0x003F9AF9|I'm not nearly weak enough that~I'd need a kid like you to~protect me.
48320|0x003F9B69|That was most rude... and also most irritating...
48321|0x003F9BA5|That was most rude... and also~most irritating...
48322|0x003F9BFE|Pretty sure that's just you being a blockhead.
48323|0x003F9C37|Pretty sure that's just you~being a blockhead.
48324|0x003F9C8F|I think it's about time you have You-san come here so he can pat your~head like the little kid you are...
48325|0x003F9D03|I think it's about time you~have You-san come here so he~can pat your head like the~little kid you are...
48326|0x003F9D94|......
48327|0x003F9DA5|......
48328|0x003F9DD5|I see that makes you blush, huh...
48329|0x003F9E02|I see that makes you blush,~huh...
48330|0x003F9E4C|I-I didn't blush!
48331|0x003F9E68|I-I didn't blush!
48332|0x003F9EAE|Hehehe... You're so funny...
48333|0x003F9ED5|Hehehe... You're so funny...
48334|0x003F9F19|...For your information, I've reached the point where I'm about to~snap.
48335|0x003F9F6C|...For your information, I've~reached the point where I'm~about to snap.
48336|0x003F9FDE|If you will excuse me, then. The person I've come with is waiting...
48337|0x003FA02D|If you will excuse me, then.~The person I've come with is~waiting...
48338|0x003FA0A0|The little girl left.
48339|0x003FA0C0|The little girl left.
48340|0x003FA0E5|She left the lookout while carrying a scythe very similar to Mare's.
48341|0x003FA134|She left the lookout while~carrying a scythe very similar~to Mare's.
48342|0x003FA188|Mare considered chasing after her and stabbing her, but she didn't~want to miss You because of that, so she decided not to.
48343|0x003FA20E|Mare considered chasing after~her and stabbing her, but she~didn't want to miss You because~of that, so she decided not to.
48344|0x003FA2BF|Magpie spread out his wings and took off again.
48345|0x003FA2F9|Magpie spread out his wings and~took off again.
48346|0x003FA39E|...What are these feelings?
48347|0x003FA3C4|...What are these feelings?
48348|0x003FA3EF|She was waiting for You.
48349|0x003FA412|She was waiting for You.
48350|0x003FA43A|Eagerly awaiting him.
48351|0x003FA45A|Eagerly awaiting him.
48352|0x003FA47F|(Does this mean that I miss him?)
48353|0x003FA4AB|(Does this mean that I miss~him?)
48354|0x003FA4DC|She imagined You petting her on the head.
48355|0x003FA510|She imagined You petting her on~the head.
48356|0x003FA549|That caused her chest to tighten up.
48357|0x003FA578|That caused her chest to~tighten up.
48358|0x003FA5AC|Her heart ached.
48359|0x003FA5C7|Her heart ached.
48360|0x003FA5E7|Strange feelings began to course through her.
48361|0x003FA61F|Strange feelings began to~course through her.
48362|0x003FA65C|She felt like crying tears of a different kind.
48363|0x003FA696|She felt like crying tears of a~different kind.
48364|0x003FA6D5|(Would he call this feeling 'love', if I told him about it?)
48365|0x003FA71C|(Would he call this feeling~'love', if I told him about~it?)
48366|0x003FA780|...Blockhead.
48367|0x003FA798|...Blockhead.
48368|0x003FA7C6|With that, Mare also left.
48369|0x003FA7EB|With that, Mare also left.
48370|0x003FA815|She couldn't bear to see You now.
48371|0x003FA841|She couldn't bear to see You~now.
48372|0x003FA8B0|BAAW!
48373|0x003FA8C0|BAAW!
48374|0x003FA906|Magpie himself spewed fire instead of words and disappeared into the~starlight, following his master.
48375|0x003FA976|Magpie himself spewed fire~instead of words and~disappeared into the starlight,~following his master.
48376|0x003FAA47|Nowhere to be seen...
48377|0x003FAA67|Nowhere to be seen...
48378|0x003FAAB1|I'd spent about thirty minutes looking for Mare, but hadn't found her~yet.
48379|0x003FAB06|I'd spent about thirty minutes~looking for Mare, but hadn't~found her yet.
48380|0x003FAB60|I thought that she was done playing hide-and-seek with me.
48381|0x003FABA5|I thought that she was done~playing hide-and-seek with me.
48382|0x003FABEF|Did she get all pumped up and hide herself real good, since it had~been so long?
48383|0x003FAC4A|Did she get all pumped up and~hide herself real good, since~it had been so long?
48384|0x003FACAA|Or maybe she just straight up decided not to come tonight?
48385|0x003FACEF|Or maybe she just straight up~decided not to come tonight?
48386|0x003FAD62|Kinda sucks... I had something to tell her, too.
48387|0x003FAD9D|Kinda sucks... I had something~to tell her, too.
48388|0x003FADDD|Namely, that I planned on confessing to Yume tomorrow.
48389|0x003FAE1E|Namely, that I planned on~confessing to Yume tomorrow.
48390|0x003FAE64|In doing so, I'd be able to sort out my feelings towards her.
48391|0x003FAEAC|In doing so, I'd be able to~sort out my feelings towards~her.
48392|0x003FAEF9|I'd be able to bring closure to my memories.
48393|0x003FAF30|I'd be able to bring closure to~my memories.
48394|0x003FAF6C|Just like Asuho did with me.
48395|0x003FAF93|Just like Asuho did with me.
48396|0x003FAFBF|The time had come for me to resolve myself as well.
48397|0x003FAFFD|The time had come for me to~resolve myself as well.
48398|0x003FB04A|...I can't slack now.
48399|0x003FB06A|...I can't slack now.
48400|0x003FB08F|Afterwards, I wanted to introduce my friends to her.
48401|0x003FB0CE|Afterwards, I wanted to~introduce my friends to her.
48402|0x003FB112|Of course, I meant to invite Mare, too.
48403|0x003FB144|Of course, I meant to invite~Mare, too.
48404|0x003FB17B|I wanted her and Yume to stand in front of each other.
48405|0x003FB1BC|I wanted her and Yume to stand~in front of each other.
48406|0x003FB202|Maybe then I would finally be able to get some answers.
48407|0x003FB244|Maybe then I would finally be~able to get some answers.
48408|0x003FB28B|The reason Mare had been waiting for me at this lookout, and also the~reason why she reaped my nightmare.
48409|0x003FB2FF|The reason Mare had been~waiting for me at this lookout,~and also the reason why she~reaped my nightmare.
48410|0x003FB378|The reason she tried to steal away my memory of Yume...
48411|0x003FB3BA|The reason she tried to steal~away my memory of Yume...
48412|0x003FB40B|...I'll make sure I get a proper reason out of her.
48413|0x003FB449|...I'll make sure I get a~proper reason out of her.
48414|0x003FB48C|It was something that had been on my mind this whole time, but I never~asked her.
48415|0x003FB4E8|It was something that had been~on my mind this whole time, but~I never asked her.
48416|0x003FB549|Because once I could be sure that the right time had come for me to~ask, Mare would tell me of her own accord.
48417|0x003FB5C2|Because once I could be sure~that the right time had come~for me to ask, Mare would tell~me of her own accord.
48418|0x003FB640|The only question being, where could I find that conviction?
48419|0x003FB687|The only question being, where~could I find that conviction?
48420|0x003FB6D3|It would take me confessing to Yume for me to have that courage.
48421|0x003FB71E|It would take me confessing to~Yume for me to have that~courage.
48422|0x003FB76E|That's where I would find that courage.
48423|0x003FB7A0|That's where I would find that~courage.
48424|0x003FB7F6|I tried searching for her for another thirty minutes, but I couldn't~find her.
48425|0x003FB84F|I tried searching for her for~another thirty minutes, but I~couldn't find her.
48426|0x003FB947|Howdy, been waiting for y'all.
48427|0x003FB970|Howdy, been waiting for y'all.
48428|0x003FB9DD|...You really think such a goofy greeting should be coming out of~someone wearing that?
48429|0x003FBA3F|...You really think such a~goofy greeting should be coming~out of someone wearing that?
48430|0x003FBAC0|You said you had something to talk about relating to Seitengu, okay?~That's the only reason I have on my formal attire. I was actually~looking forward to enjoying a nice evening drink, and you just had to~ruin it.
48431|0x003FBBA0|You said you had something to~talk about relating to~Seitengu, okay? That's the only~reason I have on my formal
48432|0x003FBC39|Well, sorry. I know it was on pretty short notice.
48433|0x003FBC76|Well, sorry. I know it was on~pretty short notice.
48434|0x003FBD07|......
48435|0x003FBD18|......
48436|0x003FBD67|It's been a while, Ren. Life with Mishima-sensei been going all right~for you?
48437|0x003FBDC0|It's been a while, Ren. Life~with Mishima-sensei been going~all right for you?
48438|0x003FBE38|Yes it has, thank you... Babysitting is no simple task though, let me~tell you...
48439|0x003FBE94|Yes it has, thank you...~Babysitting is no simple task~though, let me tell you...
48440|0x003FBF43|And who's doing the babysitting here, do I dare ask?
48441|0x003FBF82|And who's doing the babysitting~here, do I dare ask?
48442|0x003FBFE0|Myself, naturally. I have to babysit you around the clock,~Taiga-kun...
48443|0x003FC032|Myself, naturally. I have to~babysit you around the clock,~Taiga-kun...
48444|0x003FC0D0|Ahaha, it sure is a relief seeing you two bickering back and forth~just like always.
48445|0x003FC12F|Ahaha, it sure is a relief~seeing you two bickering back~and forth just like always.
48446|0x003FC1CB|Yeah, Ren can only show herself at night, so you can't just casually~come and see her.
48447|0x003FC22C|Yeah, Ren can only show herself~at night, so you can't just~casually come and see her.
48448|0x003FC2AC|I think both Souichirou and Shino would really love to say hi, too,~you know?
48449|0x003FC304|I think both Souichirou and~Shino would really love to say~hi, too, you know?
48450|0x003FC3B6|Huh... I wouldn't mind seeing Souichirou-san, but...
48451|0x003FC3F5|Huh... I wouldn't mind seeing~Souichirou-san, but...
48452|0x003FC47B|Hard for you to face Shino?
48453|0x003FC4A1|Hard for you to face Shino?
48454|0x003FC4D8|......
48455|0x003FC4E9|......
48456|0x003FC541|I keep telling that girl not to mind it, but well, you know her.
48457|0x003FC58C|I keep telling that girl not to~mind it, but well, you know~her.
48458|0x003FC5F6|Well, that's hardly convincing coming from you. I mean, you're the~single person who minds it all the most.
48459|0x003FC66C|Well, that's hardly convincing~coming from you. I mean, you're~the single person who minds it~all the most.
48460|0x003FC701|...You sure don't mince words.
48461|0x003FC72A|...You sure don't mince words.
48462|0x003FC79B|Ren, go and say hi to Shino if you get the opportunity. I guarantee~she'll be glad to see you.
48463|0x003FC804|Ren, go and say hi to Shino if~you get the opportunity. I~guarantee she'll be glad to see~you.
48464|0x003FC88C|I highly doubt that, but... okay...
48465|0x003FC8BA|I highly doubt that, but...~okay...
48466|0x003FC941|That should do for pleasantries. I actually have something to discuss.
48467|0x003FC992|That should do for~pleasantries. I actually have~something to discuss.
48468|0x003FCA2F|If it's about Seitengu, then it must be something concerning Ren.
48469|0x003FCA7B|If it's about Seitengu, then it~must be something concerning~Ren.
48470|0x003FCAE6|You could say that.
48471|0x003FCB04|You could say that.
48472|0x003FCB41|Look, I have no intention of selling out Ren to Seitengu or anything.~I told you so in the past, and my position hasn't changed since.
48473|0x003FCBD2|Look, I have no intention of~selling out Ren to Seitengu or~anything. I told you so in the~past, and my position hasn't
48474|0x003FCC73|Back in high school I loved our Astronomy Club a hell of a lot more~than being a Seitengu shrine maiden, and even now that I'm the head~priestess, I still value all my friends from back then.
48475|0x003FCD3D|Back in high school I loved our~Astronomy Club a hell of a lot~more than being a Seitengu~shrine maiden, and even now
48476|0x003FCDDC|You should know that both you and Ren are included in that.
48477|0x003FCE22|You should know that both you~and Ren are included in that.
48478|0x003FCE87|I do. Fact is, I haven't seen a single shrine maiden come to~exterminate Ren until now.
48479|0x003FCEE9|I do. Fact is, I haven't seen a~single shrine maiden come to~exterminate Ren until now.
48480|0x003FCF6A|...Until now?
48481|0x003FCF82|...Until now?
48482|0x003FCFAB|Yeah, that's right.
48483|0x003FCFC9|Yeah, that's right.
48484|0x003FD03B|For clarity's sake, I don't seem to be their objective... but~regardless, they are examining the lookout.
48485|0x003FD0AF|For clarity's sake, I don't~seem to be their objective...~but regardless, they are~examining the lookout.
48486|0x003FD160|...You came across a Seitengu shrine maiden?
48487|0x003FD197|...You came across a Seitengu~shrine maiden?
48488|0x003FD20C|Ren says she saw one at the lookout.
48489|0x003FD23B|Ren says she saw one at the~lookout.
48490|0x003FD2AF|At that time, I did what I thought was best, and purposely made~footsteps to drive her away without revealing myself.
48491|0x003FD32F|At that time, I did what I~thought was best, and purposely~made footsteps to drive her~away without revealing myself.
48492|0x003FD3FE|Exterminating contumacious existences or what is oftentimes also~called 'Suppression of Vile Deities' is what Seitengu assumes as its~calling. It's the type of work they don't want normal people be aware~of, so you made the right call, Ren.
48493|0x003FD4F9|Exterminating contumacious~existences or what is~oftentimes also called~'Suppression of Vile Deities'
48494|0x003FD5A7|Judging by what Ren relayed to me, that shrine maiden might be after~the lookout's shinigami.
48495|0x003FD60F|Judging by what Ren relayed to~me, that shrine maiden might be~after the lookout's shinigami.
48496|0x003FD696|I've received reports about the lookout shinigami from Setsuna, too.~But I mean, that's just Ren, right?
48497|0x003FD709|I've received reports about the~lookout shinigami from Setsuna,~too. But I mean, that's just~Ren, right?
48498|0x003FD78D|I haven't reported Ren to Seitengu. Not in the past, nor now. I'd~never do something like that.
48499|0x003FD7F7|I haven't reported Ren to~Seitengu. Not in the past, nor~now. I'd never do something~like that.
48500|0x003FD872|So they must have gotten word from some other source.
48501|0x003FD8B2|So they must have gotten word~from some other source.
48502|0x003FD911|Hold on. I gotta correct you on one thing before you go on.
48503|0x003FD957|Hold on. I gotta correct you on~one thing before you go on.
48504|0x003FD9BC|What do I have wrong?
48505|0x003FD9DC|What do I have wrong?
48506|0x003FDA1B|Ren isn't the shinigami at the lookout. It's a little girl called~Mare.
48507|0x003FDA6D|Ren isn't the shinigami at the~lookout. It's a little girl~called Mare.
48508|0x003FDADE|...Who's that?
48509|0x003FDAF7|...Who's that?
48510|0x003FDB64|According to what Chinami-san told me, apparently she is an alien that~engages in stargazing together with the Astro Club...
48511|0x003FDBEB|According to what Chinami-san~told me, apparently she is an~alien that engages in~stargazing together with the
48512|0x003FDC83|In fact, I met her in person once and well... she is quite the~irritating little kid indeed...
48513|0x003FDCEC|In fact, I met her in person~once and well... she is quite~the irritating little kid~indeed...
48514|0x003FDD95|Guess our best bet, logically speaking, is to consider her as the same~sort of person as Ren.
48515|0x003FDDFD|Guess our best bet, logically~speaking, is to consider her as~the same sort of person as Ren.
48516|0x003FDE84|Well, I'm not an alien, but yes, I believe she is...
48517|0x003FDEC3|Well, I'm not an alien, but~yes, I believe she is...
48518|0x003FDF47|...So you're telling me the lookout shinigami is a little girl that~goes by the name Mare, and she is, in fact, an Astral Deity?
48519|0x003FDFD2|...So you're telling me the~lookout shinigami is a little~girl that goes by the name~Mare, and she is, in fact, an
48520|0x003FE060|Both Taiga-kun and I believe so...
48521|0x003FE08D|Both Taiga-kun and I believe~so...
48522|0x003FE0D9|Does that mean a whole three Astral Deities have gathered here in~Hibarigasaki before I knew it?
48523|0x003FE144|Does that mean a whole three~Astral Deities have gathered~here in Hibarigasaki before I~knew it?
48524|0x003FE1EE|You have Ren, Mare, and Kosame, so yeah that makes three, all right.
48525|0x003FE23D|You have Ren, Mare, and Kosame,~so yeah that makes three, all~right.
48526|0x003FE2AB|Ren's host object is your meteorite and Kosame's is the Hibarigasaki~meteorite. So then what about the lookout shinigami's host object...
48527|0x003FE33F|Ren's host object is your~meteorite and Kosame's is the~Hibarigasaki meteorite. So then~what about the lookout
48528|0x003FE3C9|The logical conclusion is that there must be another meteorite around~here we don't know of.
48529|0x003FE430|The logical conclusion is that~there must be another meteorite~around here we don't know of.
48530|0x003FE4A8|...Boy, I couldn't have picked a better region to be head priestess.
48531|0x003FE4F7|...Boy, I couldn't have picked~a better region to be head~priestess.
48532|0x003FE565|I feel for your ill fate.
48533|0x003FE589|I feel for your ill fate.
48534|0x003FE5CC|I refuse to show any compassion for Seitengu, who just goes and treats~perfectly decent beings, such as ourselves, as nothing more than~pests...
48535|0x003FE667|I refuse to show any compassion~for Seitengu, who just goes and~treats perfectly decent beings,~such as ourselves, as nothing
48536|0x003FE70E|...Did you just come here to gripe at me?
48537|0x003FE742|...Did you just come here to~gripe at me?
48538|0x003FE795|We just came to ask you about the shrine maiden that's set on~exterminating the lookout shinigami.
48539|0x003FE802|We just came to ask you about~the shrine maiden that's set on~exterminating the lookout~shinigami.
48540|0x003FE88E|After all, there's no guarantee Ren won't suffer harm, too.
48541|0x003FE8D4|After all, there's no guarantee~Ren won't suffer harm, too.
48542|0x003FE939|There is no need for you to protect me, I'll be just fine...
48543|0x003FE980|There is no need for you to~protect me, I'll be just~fine...
48544|0x003FEA21|Don't be like that.
48545|0x003FEA3F|Don't be like that.
48546|0x003FEA87|D-Don't... touch my hair...
48547|0x003FEAAD|D-Don't... touch my hair...
48548|0x003FEB20|All this time, I thought the lookout shinigami was Ren. I've been~ordering Setsuna to leave her alone when I receive reports from her.
48549|0x003FEBB1|All this time, I thought the~lookout shinigami was Ren. I've~been ordering Setsuna to leave~her alone when I receive
48550|0x003FEC4F|So, to be honest, I'm just as clueless as you guys are about this~shrine maiden.
48551|0x003FECAA|So, to be honest, I'm just as~clueless as you guys are about~this shrine maiden.
48552|0x003FED42|But no matter how you look at it, that's a Seitengu shrine maiden.
48553|0x003FED8F|But no matter how you look at~it, that's a Seitengu shrine~maiden.
48554|0x003FEDFB|I'm getting the feeling she was sent from the main shrine, just like~Setsuna. That means there's only two possibilies. Either Setsuna~reported the lookout shinigami to the main shrine behind my back...
48555|0x003FEECF|I'm getting the feeling she was~sent from the main shrine, just~like Setsuna. That means~there's only two possibilies.
48556|0x003FEF6F|Or that shrine maiden has been dispatched here due to some other~objective of theirs.
48557|0x003FEFCF|Or that shrine maiden has been~dispatched here due to some~other objective of theirs.
48558|0x003FF083|Is there really anything besides myself and the lookout shinigami that~would be of interest to them...?
48559|0x003FF0F5|Is there really anything~besides myself and the lookout~shinigami that would be of~interest to them...?
48560|0x003FF1A4|One thing.
48561|0x003FF1B9|One thing.
48562|0x003FF20C|What's that?
48563|0x003FF223|What's that?
48564|0x003FF259|Our very own Kosame.
48565|0x003FF278|Our very own Kosame.
48566|0x003FF2B6|......
48567|0x003FF2C7|......
48568|0x003FF31F|The thing is, Kosame's kind of an issue within Seitengu. An Astral~Spirit that borrows the power of an Astral Deity has been entirely~unprecedented up until now.
48569|0x003FF3CB|The thing is, Kosame's kind of~an issue within Seitengu. An~Astral Spirit that borrows the~power of an Astral Deity has
48570|0x003FF46C|Nevertheless, they've been content just waiting to see what would~happen. They left dealing with Kosame entirely in my hands.
48571|0x003FF4F4|Nevertheless, they've been~content just waiting to see~what would happen. They left~dealing with Kosame entirely in
48572|0x003FF583|That stance didn't change after I requested Setsuna to be dispatched~in order to send Kosame back. If anything, it became even more~striking.
48573|0x003FF61B|That stance didn't change after~I requested Setsuna to be~dispatched in order to send~Kosame back. If anything, it
48574|0x003FF6B7|But I can't rule out the possibility that they've changed their minds~at this point. It'd sure make the most sense, for one.
48575|0x003FF73E|But I can't rule out the~possibility that they've~changed their minds at this~point. It'd sure make the most
48576|0x003FF7D4|After all, Setsuna stepped down from her job.
48577|0x003FF80C|After all, Setsuna stepped down~from her job.
48578|0x003FF855|She couldn't bring herself to send Kosame back.
48579|0x003FF88F|She couldn't bring herself to~send Kosame back.
48580|0x003FF911|...That does sound pretty plausible.
48581|0x003FF940|...That does sound pretty~plausible.
48582|0x003FF9B6|Given the premise that there is a contumacious existence that even a~shrine maiden from the main shrine can't send back... It may be~understandable that they would see her as dangerous...
48583|0x003FFA7C|Given the premise that there is~a contumacious existence that~even a shrine maiden from the~main shrine can't send back...
48584|0x003FFB4D|Yeah, maybe they thought that's how rampant Kosame is. In reality,~it's the exact opposite, but those guys're much too narrow-minded to~consider that.
48585|0x003FFBEE|Yeah, maybe they thought that's~how rampant Kosame is. In~reality, it's the exact~opposite, but those guys're
48586|0x003FFC85|The fact that they dispatched a shrine maiden without giving me any~notice probably means they're set to go through with that.
48587|0x003FFD0E|The fact that they dispatched a~shrine maiden without giving me~any notice probably means~they're set to go through with
48588|0x003FFDCE|At school, Suwa's kind of standoffish in a way, but she still keeps up~with her schoolwork. How's she doing with you?
48589|0x003FFE4E|At school, Suwa's kind of~standoffish in a way, but she~still keeps up with her~schoolwork. How's she doing
48590|0x003FFEE3|She said she'd ask Seitengu to punish her, but I'm having her remain~here. I'd say it's safe to assume she won't be able to come back here~once she returns there.

48592|0x00400035|If they really are after Kosame, I reckon I should keep it that way.~After all, I meant to ask her to bodyguard Kosame from the start.

48596|0x00400265|When it comes to fighting, I'm quite positive Ren would be more~helpful than you though.

48598|0x0040037F|If you want, I would be more than glad to reap that bad shrine maiden~with my scythe...
48599|0x004003E1|If you want, I would be more~than glad to reap that bad~shrine maiden with my scythe...
48600|0x00400483|I doubt sending back her contumacious existence would actually repel~her though.
48601|0x004004DE|I doubt sending back her~contumacious existence would~actually repel her though.
48602|0x00400555|I will batter her with the shaft...
48603|0x00400583|I will batter her with the~shaft...
48604|0x004005EE|Ahaha. I'll be sure to take you up on that if the time comes.
48605|0x00400636|Ahaha. I'll be sure to take you~up on that if the time comes.
48606|0x0040069D|Well, if possible, I'd rather that shrine maiden end up leaving before~things get that messy.
48607|0x00400705|Well, if possible, I'd rather~that shrine maiden end up~leaving before things get that~messy.
48608|0x0040078C|I don't know which shrine maiden they dispatched, so there's nothing I~can say right now.
48609|0x004007F0|I don't know which shrine~maiden they dispatched, so~there's nothing I can say right~now.
48610|0x00400873|So does that mean we're done here for the present...?
48611|0x004008B3|So does that mean we're done~here for the present...?
48612|0x00400912|Guess the conclusion is that we'll just have to keep our guard up.
48613|0x0040095F|Guess the conclusion is that~we'll just have to keep our~guard up.
48614|0x004009CB|This is strictly our mess, so I'll make sure to avoid troubling you~all as much as possible.
48615|0x00400A32|This is strictly our mess, so~I'll make sure to avoid~troubling you all as much as~possible.
48616|0x00400AB8|I'd love to just say you do that and be done with it, but I'll help~where I can. At the end of the day, you're still my cute little~student from back in high school.

48619|0x00400C47|It's kind of embarrassing~hearing that at this age.
48620|0x00400CA4|Well anyway, sorry to bother you this late at night, Mayaka.
48621|0x00400CEB|Well anyway, sorry to bother~you this late at night, Mayaka.
48622|0x00400D51|You're going already? At least stay with me and have a drink or two.
48623|0x00400DA0|You're going already? At least~stay with me and have a drink~or two.
48624|0x00400E2D|I have a rather low tolerance when it comes to alcohol...
48625|0x00400E71|I have a rather low tolerance~when it comes to alcohol...
48626|0x00400ED4|Pretty measly for a deity, I'll say.
48627|0x00400F03|Pretty measly for a deity, I'll~say.
48628|0x00400F51|That is quite rude... and irritating...
48629|0x00400F83|That is quite rude... and~irritating...
48630|0x00400FD4|Ahaha, it's a bit weird to say that now after all this time, but you~really are a queer little thing, Ren.
48631|0x00401049|Ahaha, it's a bit weird to say~that now after all this time,~but you really are a queer~little thing, Ren.
48632|0x004010FC|Yeah, that should hardly be anything new to a head priestess like you.
48633|0x0040114D|Yeah, that should hardly be~anything new to a head~priestess like you.
48634|0x004011BD|Well, at my core, I'm not much for superstition. My other daughter,~Komomo, is the same way.
48635|0x00401224|Well, at my core, I'm not much~for superstition. My other~daughter, Komomo, is the same~way.
48636|0x004012AA|And yet you succeeded the shrine.
48637|0x004012D6|And yet you succeeded the~shrine.
48638|0x00401321|Well, I'm not one to pass up on a mysterious adventure. I love them.
48639|0x00401370|Well, I'm not one to pass up on~a mysterious adventure. I love~them.
48640|0x004013DE|Let me kindly inform you that you're contradicting yourself there.~You'll have some just deserts coming your way eventually...

48642|0x00401501|I remember you saying this, Ren, but do you really not know what you~are?
48643|0x00401555|I remember you saying this,~Ren, but do you really not know~what you are?
48644|0x004015F8|No... I was able to get a rough idea from the myths that are passed~down on this planet, but that is all...
48645|0x0040166E|No... I was able to get a rough~idea from the myths that are~passed down on this planet, but~that is all...
48646|0x00401703|It is similar to how you humans can't fully explain your own~biological functions...
48647|0x00401762|It is similar to how you humans~can't fully explain your own~biological functions...
48648|0x00401805|How much do you understand about Ren?
48649|0x00401835|How much do you understand~about Ren?
48650|0x004018A2|Well, you know that we humans require light in order to see things,~right?
48651|0x004018F7|Well, you know that we humans~require light in order to see~things, right?
48652|0x0040196B|Well sure, you can't see anything in the dark.
48653|0x004019A4|Well sure, you can't see~anything in the dark.
48654|0x004019FC|Besides, you can also see it in how we from Seitengu borrow the light~of relics to make Contumacious Deities visible.
48655|0x00401A7C|Besides, you can also see it in~how we from Seitengu borrow the~light of relics to make~Contumacious Deities visible.
48656|0x00401B1B|So next question. You know how electromagnetic waves are essential to~studying objects in space, a realm almost entirely comprised of~darkness? It's mainly important in radio astronomy, and the more~recent gravitational-wave astronomy.
48657|0x00401C11|So next question. You know how~electromagnetic waves are~essential to studying objects~in space, a realm almost
48658|0x00401CAA|...I don't know anything about that stuff.
48659|0x00401CDF|...I don't know anything about~that stuff.
48660|0x00401D54|The fact of the matter is, for us to see something, or even to just~observe it period, there has to be an output of electromagnetic waves.
48661|0x00401DE9|The fact of the matter is, for~us to see something, or even to~just observe it period, there~has to be an output of
48662|0x00401E78|Though even with that said, modern day space observation doesn't use~the full electromagnetic spectrum.
48663|0x00401EEA|Though even with that said,~modern day space observation~doesn't use the full~electromagnetic spectrum.
48664|0x00401F7B|The reason is a simple one. They couldn't use it even if they wanted~to.
48665|0x00401FCE|The reason is a simple one.~They couldn't use it even if~they wanted to.
48666|0x00402032|We still don't know everything there is to know about electromagnetic~radiation. Even today, there's still some frequency ranges under~active research.
48667|0x004020D4|We still don't know everything~there is to know about~electromagnetic radiation. Even~today, there's still some
48668|0x0040215F|In that sense, space is full of mysteries.
48669|0x00402194|In that sense, space is full of~mysteries.
48670|0x004021E8|That also applies to Ren. It's the reason Ren can be both visible and~invisible to us.
48671|0x00402249|That also applies to Ren. It's~the reason Ren can be both~visible and invisible to us.
48672|0x004022BB|Just like science has its limits, our perception has its limits, too.
48673|0x0040230B|Just like science has its~limits, our perception has its~limits, too.
48674|0x0040236C|Just like space observation has its limits, our perception of Ren has~its limits, too.
48675|0x004023CD|Just like space observation has~its limits, our perception of~Ren has its limits, too.
48676|0x0040244D|To begin with, information from the third-dimension alone isn't~sufficient for the light required to properly perceive her.

48678|0x0040259A|...Hold on. Make this a little easier to understand.
48679|0x004025D9|...Hold on. Make this a little~easier to understand.
48680|0x00402637|Okay then. In short, Ren is a being from a higher dimension.
48681|0x0040267E|Okay then. In short, Ren is a~being from a higher dimension.
48682|0x0040270F|There are multiple ways to define a dimension, but for simplicity's~sake, we'll just say the plane coordinates of mass. If something is in~a different dimension, that means there's a difference in terms of~coordinate axes.
48683|0x004027F8|There are multiple ways to~define a dimension, but for~simplicity's sake, we'll just~say the plane coordinates of
48684|0x00402885|In that sense, you could essentially call dimensions the boundaries of~sets of physical laws.
48685|0x004028ED|In that sense, you could~essentially call dimensions the~boundaries of sets of physical~laws.
48686|0x00402966|So unlike us, Ren isn't bound by the physical laws of the third~dimension.
48687|0x004029BB|So unlike us, Ren isn't bound~by the physical laws of the~third dimension.
48688|0x00402A2F|A lower dimension being can't willingly make contact with a being of a~higher dimension, but that isn't the case the other way round.

48692|0x00402CC3|It's the same principle.
48693|0x00402CE6|It's the same principle.
48694|0x00402D4F|...I'm still lost. It sounds like some sci-fi crap.
48695|0x00402D8D|...I'm still lost. It sounds~like some sci-fi crap.
48696|0x00402DEA|It's just modern physics.

48702|0x00402FCD|Same damn thing to me. Just shut yourself away and leave me alone.~Chirp on about your bogus, self-satisfying theories for all your life.

48709|0x004033C6|Taiga-kun's meteorite is filled~with it as well, I think...
48710|0x0040344C|True. There are many different types of electromagnetic waves in terms~of wavelength out there. Starting at the longest with radio waves,~then you have microwaves, visible light, infrared, ultraviolet,~X-rays, gamma rays, and so on...
48711|0x00403541|True. There are many different~types of electromagnetic waves~in terms of wavelength out~there. Starting at the longest
48712|0x004035D4|In space, you've even got cosmic rays, which are at a higher energy~than all the other types I mentioned, flying around.

48720|0x0040396E|The cosmic rays aboard those meteorites have an effect on us. We gain~the ability to see beings we wouldn't be able to otherwise.

48724|0x00403BEB|Well, that's the way I see it from a purely scientific viewpoint.

48726|0x00403CC9|Sounds just like how planetariums work.
48727|0x00403CFB|Sounds just like how~planetariums work.
48728|0x00403D4C|Yep. It's a star-made projector, basically.
48729|0x00403D82|Yep. It's a star-made~projector, basically.
48730|0x00403DD7|Yet, it isn't just seeing her, but also touching her. You really are a~queer little thing, Ren.
48731|0x00403E41|Yet, it isn't just seeing her,~but also touching her. You~really are a queer little~thing, Ren.

48733|0x00403F2F|D-Don't... touch my hair...
48734|0x00403F92|And it's not like I can only touch her. She can also touch me.
48735|0x00403FDB|And it's not like I can only~touch her. She can also touch~me.

48749|0x004044B7|I-I am not...
48750|0x00404516|Ahaha, now I've got the urge to go have a stargazing session with the~old gang. It's been ages.

48752|0x00404609|It'd be a tough job to get us all back together though.
48753|0x0040464B|It'd be a tough job to get us~all back together though.
48754|0x004046DE|Chihiro isn't around anymore, though...
48755|0x00404710|Chihiro isn't around anymore,~though...
48756|0x00404761|But who knows? Maybe it's just that we can't see him and he's around~somewhere.
48757|0x004047BB|But who knows? Maybe it's just~that we can't see him and he's~around somewhere.
48758|0x00404834|Maybe he'll be gazing up at Hibarigasaki's starry sky right there with~us.
48759|0x00404889|Maybe he'll be gazing up at~Hibarigasaki's starry sky right~there with us.
48760|0x00404941|This was the day. I had steeled myself to do it.
48761|0x0040497C|This was the day. I had steeled~myself to do it.
48762|0x004049E6|I was going to confess to Yume today.
48763|0x00404A16|I was going to confess to Yume~today.
48764|0x00404A4B|For that purpose, I waited for visiting hours to start, and then I~headed to the hospital.
48765|0x00404AB0|For that purpose, I waited for~visiting hours to start, and~then I headed to the hospital.
48766|0x00404B1A|I showed up earlier than I usually do on weekends.
48767|0x00404B57|I showed up earlier than I~usually do on weekends.
48768|0x00404BB7|While making my way over to the west ward where Yume's hospital room~was, I considered how to go about confessing.

48770|0x00404CB6|I'd been racking my brains out about that constantly since last night,~but my thoughts just kept spinning in circles without me ever arriving~at a conclusion.
48771|0x00404D5F|I'd been racking my brains out~about that constantly since~last night, but my thoughts~just kept spinning in circles
48772|0x00404DE3|Thanks to that, even though I was ready to go through with it, I had~nothing that even resembled a plan.
48773|0x00404E56|Thanks to that, even though I~was ready to go through with~it, I had nothing that even~resembled a plan.
48774|0x00404ECE|I suppose the timing at which to confess depends on the flow of the~conversation and can't exactly be planned either.

48776|0x00404FD3|My entire body was tense, but not restless.
48777|0x00405009|My entire body was tense, but~not restless.
48778|0x00405044|What happens will happen. I'm positive there is no one right set of~words to confess with, so the most important thing is whether I can~actually muster the courage to come out with it.

48780|0x00405190|It would be a far greater problem than anything else if I just got~cold feet as I was about to do it and ended up unable to say a thing.

48782|0x004052A4|(Can I really do this?)

48786|0x00405386|I arrived at Yume's room.
48787|0x004053AA|I arrived at Yume's room.
48788|0x004053D3|I was ready to tell her the words now that I couldn't all those years~back.
48789|0x00405429|I was ready to tell her the~words now that I couldn't all~those years back.
48790|0x00405484|This is why I kept cherishing my memories of Yume all this time~without ever forgetting them.
48791|0x004054EC|This is why I kept cherishing~my memories of Yume all this~time without ever forgetting~them.
48792|0x00405588|But to my surprise, the room turned out to be completely empty.

48794|0x0040562B|Ahh...
48795|0x0040563C|Ahh...
48796|0x00405652|All the tension left my body.
48797|0x0040567A|All the tension left my body.
48798|0x004056A7|The bed was empty. Yume was nowhere to be seen.
48799|0x004056E1|The bed was empty. Yume was~nowhere to be seen.
48800|0x00405720|It was probably just an examination. I'd already encountered this~several times while visiting her.
48801|0x0040578E|It was probably just an~examination. I'd already~encountered this several times~while visiting her.
48802|0x00405801|I just needed to sit quietly and wait for her to get back.
48803|0x00405846|I just needed to sit quietly~and wait for her to get back.
48804|0x004058C7|I sat in a chair near the bed.
48805|0x004058F0|I sat in a chair near the bed.
48806|0x00405938|I directed my gaze out the window.
48807|0x00405965|I directed my gaze out the~window.
48808|0x004059CD|Yume often stood by this window and gazed out at the sea.
48809|0x00405A11|Yume often stood by this window~and gazed out at the sea.

48811|0x00405AB8|Staring at the waves, as they~continuously broke on the beach~only to recede again.
48812|0x00405B1B|I always found her doing that when I came here.
48813|0x00405B55|I always found her doing that~when I came here.
48814|0x00405B94|Maybe after I left, she went back to doing that until her tutor~arrived.
48815|0x00405BE7|Maybe after I left, she went~back to doing that until her~tutor arrived.
48816|0x00405C3F|The waves breaking and receding ─ an endless repetition.

48818|0x00405CCC|A daily cycle never ending.

48820|0x00405D1D|It seems like she felt a sense of envy when she looked out at that~sight.

48822|0x00405DD4|......

48824|0x00405E39|I averted my eyes from the window and faced forward.

48826|0x00405EE1|The white pillow and bedsheets were brand new.
48827|0x00405F1A|The white pillow and bedsheets~were brand new.
48828|0x00405F58|They looked to be freshly cleaned. I couldn't spot a single wrinkle.
48829|0x00405FA7|They looked to be freshly~cleaned. I couldn't spot a~single wrinkle.
48830|0x00405FFB|Maybe they decided to change them while Yume was out getting her~examination?
48831|0x00406053|Maybe they decided to change~them while Yume was out getting~her examination?
48832|0x004060B0|She said her examinations don't take long.
48833|0x004060E5|She said her examinations don't~take long.
48834|0x0040611F|Yet, for whatever reason, she was still gone.
48835|0x00406157|Yet, for whatever reason, she~was still gone.
48836|0x00406194|Maybe it was just taking them longer than usual today?
48837|0x004061D5|Maybe it was just taking them~longer than usual today?
48838|0x0040621B|That would explain why they had the time to change out the pillows and~sheets, at the very least.
48839|0x00406287|That would explain why they had~the time to change out the~pillows and sheets, at the very~least.
48840|0x004062F8|Come to think of it, I wonder how often they wash the sheets of~hospital beds.
48841|0x00406351|Come to think of it, I wonder~how often they wash the sheets~of hospital beds.
48842|0x004063AF|Every day? Once per week?
48843|0x004063D3|Every day? Once per week?
48844|0x004063FC|Yume often complained to me about her life in the hospital. She~undoubtedly spent the vast majority of her time in this room.

48848|0x0040659C|So when would they find the time to wash them?
48849|0x004065D5|So when would they find the~time to wash them?
48850|0x00406613|Well, I'd say they definitely do it when a patient gets discharged~from the hospital.
48851|0x00406673|Well, I'd say they definitely~do it when a patient gets~discharged from the hospital.
48852|0x004066D8|And if the patient has passed on, I assume they would also put clean~sheets on the bed.

48859|0x00406867|I stood up.
48860|0x00406898|I did so with quite a lot of force, and the chair jolted with a loud~clatter.
48861|0x004068F0|I did so with quite a lot of~force, and the chair jolted~with a loud clatter.
48862|0x0040694D|I then turned towards the door.

48878|0x00406DDE|Yume was looking up at me from close proximity.

48882|0x00406ED6|But now there was more of a difference.

48884|0x00406F3F|Have I grown up enough to be able to keep her safe?

48984|0x00408343|She got into bed in high spirits.
48985|0x0040836F|She got into bed in high~spirits.
48986|0x004083A0|Since no one except her was using that bed, her being first didn't~really mean anything... and more importantly, I wasn't able to confess~to her.

48993|0x00408636|All right, then. Let's have~ourselves another nice chat~about astronomy.
48994|0x0040868E|It's not like I wouldn't enjoy that, but if I let her keep control of~the conversation, it was guaranteed that this would end up as just one~of my normal, regular visits.

49151|0x0040AA92|She didn't want me to visit her~any more...

49154|0x0040AB8E|Yume.

49202|0x0040B755|She said she enjoyed having me come visit her.
49203|0x0040B78E|She said she enjoyed having me~come visit her.

49301|0x0040CCE8|Yume was my very first friend.

49650|0x00412F9A|Without telling me either her grade or class.
49651|0x00412FD2|Without telling me either her~grade or class.
49652|0x0041300F|So I had no way to go see her myself.

49655|0x004130BD|Unless she approached me, it~wasn't possible to see her~again.
49656|0x00413121|From then on, I started paying careful attention to my surroundings~whenever I was going home all by myself.
49657|0x00413198|From then on, I started paying~careful attention to my~surroundings whenever I was~going home all by myself.
49658|0x00413214|Thinking Yume might be there again somewhere.
49659|0x0041324C|Thinking Yume might be there~again somewhere.

49668|0x004135B5|Eventually my efforts came to fruition.
49669|0x004135E7|Eventually my efforts came to~fruition.
49670|0x0041361E|Whenever I was lucky enough to spot her at the school gate or in town,~I would then always hesitate to go up to her.
49671|0x0041369D|Whenever I was lucky enough to~spot her at the school gate or~in town, I would then always~hesitate to go up to her.

49673|0x00413777|So as I was standing there~dawdling around, she would~always come up to me.
49674|0x004137D2|Acting all big sister-esque, she would invite me, saying, Did you want~me to play with you?

49678|0x0041397C|But I always continued searching for her again after that.
49679|0x004139C1|But I always continued~searching for her again after~that.
49680|0x00413A0B|I would eventually discover her by chance, dawdle around indecisively,~have her approach me, and then part again like I was running away from~her.

49687|0x00413C3C|Our meetings and partings thus~repeated for a while in that~fashion.
49688|0x00413C90|Still, ever-so-gradually, our conversations grew longer.
49689|0x00413CD3|Still, ever-so-gradually, our~conversations grew longer.
49690|0x00413D1B|And I started being able to act more casual around her.

49692|0x00413DA4|The amount of time I spent with her grew.

49694|0x00413E11|After that had continued on for a while, one day she led me to the~lookout.

49794|0x004158C6|The lights of the moon, the stars, and the town unfolded before my~eyes.
49795|0x00415919|The lights of the moon, the~stars, and the town unfolded~before my eyes.
49796|0x00415971|All those lights seemed so close to one other, like they were~snuggling up to one another, but in reality, they were so far apart.

49798|0x00415A7D|There's a certain distance between each individual house.
49799|0x00415AC1|There's a certain distance~between each individual house.
49800|0x00415B0A|And between the stars, that distance is filled with the cold, dark~vastness of empty space.

49802|0x00415BE5|Are... humans all alone?
49803|0x00415C08|Are... humans all alone?
49804|0x00415C3A|I wouldn't say we are.
49805|0x00415C5B|I wouldn't say we are.
49806|0x00415C8B|The appearance that we're so close together may just be an illusion,~but I still can't say we're truly alone.
49807|0x00415D03|The appearance that we're so~close together may just be an~illusion, but I still can't say~we're truly alone.

49814|0x00415F07|Yeah, exactly.

49816|0x00415F48|I did come out of it with a broken heart though, and that kinda sucks.

49818|0x00416004|......
49819|0x00416015|......

49823|0x0041618E|So I tried telling her my~feelings, and confessing to~her, but she rejected me.
49824|0x004161F7|So here I am, still without a conclusion about whether that really was~my first love, and whether I'm in love with her.
49825|0x00416279|So here I am, still without a~conclusion about whether that~really was my first love, and~whether I'm in love with her.

49828|0x004163B7|It's strange.

49856|0x00416977|......

49859|0x004169E6|After all, I made a promise~with her.
49860|0x00416A25|She said she wanted you to forget about her...
49861|0x00416A5E|She said she wanted you to~forget about her...
49862|0x00416AB4|That is exactly why I was waiting for you.
49863|0x00416AE9|That is exactly why I was~waiting for you.
49864|0x00416B3B|I stayed at this lookout for a long time, waiting for you.
49865|0x00416B80|I stayed at this lookout for a~long time, waiting for you.
49866|0x00416BE2|I honestly didn't know for sure that your nightmare was your memories~of her.
49867|0x00416C3A|I honestly didn't know for sure~that your nightmare was your~memories of her.
49868|0x00416CA1|Nor did I know what exactly about her you'd forget even given that was~the case.
49869|0x00416CFC|Nor did I know what exactly~about her you'd forget even~given that was the case.
49870|0x00416D74|But the one and only thing I can do is reap nightmares.
49871|0x00416DB6|But the one and only thing I~can do is reap nightmares.
49872|0x00416E15|Which is why I reaped you with my scythe.
49873|0x00416E49|Which is why I reaped you with~my scythe.
49874|0x00416E8C|...So that was it, huh?
49875|0x00416EAE|...So that was it, huh?
49876|0x00416EED|Yeah.
49877|0x00416EFD|Yeah.
49878|0x00416F12|So Mare had already met Yume.
49879|0x00416F3A|So Mare had already met Yume.
49880|0x00416F67|And it would seem it was right after I moved away.
49881|0x00416FA4|And it would seem it was right~after I moved away.

49895|0x004172F6|These feelings that I'd~sheltered over the course of~seven whole years had actually~already been shattered seven
49896|0x00417376|It all makes sense now that I think about it.
49897|0x004173AE|It all makes sense now that I~think about it.
49898|0x004173EB|How she said she'd ban me from visiting her at any given~opportunity... How she fervently tried to act as though we'd never~met...
49899|0x00417478|How she said she'd ban me from~visiting her at any given~opportunity... How she~fervently tried to act as

50016|0x0041896C|A really strange one...
50017|0x0041898E|A really strange one...

50024|0x00418B4C|Will your pain go away... if you get to feel strange?
50025|0x00418B8C|Will your pain go away... if~you get to feel strange?

50029|0x00418CBB|I'd have to see.
50030|0x00418CDB|However, maybe...

50034|0x00418D87|You've even turned me into a blockhead...

50036|0x00418E13|Mare moved a little away from me and climbed up onto the handrail.
50037|0x00418E60|Mare moved a little away from~me and climbed up onto the~handrail.
50038|0x00418EB2|She did it so lightly, it made me think she was as light as a feather.
50039|0x00418F03|She did it so lightly, it made~me think she was as light as a~feather.
50040|0x00418F59|She leaned her tiny body towards me and whispered.

50046|0x004190FD|She lightly brought her lips toward my forehead and kissed me.

50048|0x00419194|It was almost like an episode out of my memories.
50049|0x004191D0|It was almost like an episode~out of my memories.
50050|0x00419211|But one thing was clearly different this time.
50051|0x0041924A|But one thing was clearly~different this time.
50052|0x00419288|I wasn't so young anymore.
50053|0x004192AD|I wasn't so young anymore.
50054|0x004192D7|I was no longer an innocent kid.
50055|0x00419302|I was no longer an innocent~kid.
50056|0x00419332|Now that I'd experienced what an unrequited love is like, I could~confidently say that I was no longer some kid innocent to love.
50057|0x004193BE|Now that I'd experienced what~an unrequited love is like, I~could confidently say that I~was no longer some kid innocent
50058|0x00419446|Just like how the girl before me, Mare, was different from Yume...
50059|0x00419493|Just like how the girl before~me, Mare, was different from~Yume...
50060|0x004194E5|I was still the boy from all those years ago, yet also not, in a~sense.
50061|0x00419537|I was still the boy from all~those years ago, yet also not,~in a sense.
50062|0x0041958E|Things appeared to have changed, when in reality they stayed the same.
50063|0x004195DF|Things appeared to have~changed, when in reality they~stayed the same.
50064|0x00419635|But that isn't to say things don't ever change.
50065|0x0041966F|But that isn't to say things~don't ever change.
50066|0x004196D6|So I should let my memories rest as what they are: memories.
50067|0x0041971D|So I should let my memories~rest as what they are:~memories.
50068|0x00419769|I realized then that it was time to search for my love in the present~day.
50069|0x004197BE|I realized then that it was~time to search for my love in~the present day.
50070|0x004198DE|I sure was surprised. Yume-san knows like sooo much about astronomy!
50071|0x0041992D|I sure was surprised. Yume-san~knows like sooo much about~astronomy!
50072|0x004199BE|She sure does. I'd say she's on par with Okaizumi-senpai. Even when it~comes to constellation myths, she just might be on the same level as~you.
50073|0x00419A59|She sure does. I'd say she's on~par with Okaizumi-senpai. Even~when it comes to constellation~myths, she just might be on the
50074|0x00419B00|It's totally no wonder she's the reason you got into the stars!
50075|0x00419B4A|It's totally no wonder she's~the reason you got into the~stars!
50076|0x00419BB1|Well, she gave me the initial impetus for sure, but I think it's you~who truly dragged me into the world of astronomy, Asuho.
50077|0x00419C39|Well, she gave me the initial~impetus for sure, but I think~it's you who truly dragged me~into the world of astronomy,
50078|0x00419CFD|Makes sense. She was the one who invited you into the Astro Club,~after all.
50079|0x00419D54|Makes sense. She was the one~who invited you into the Astro~Club, after all.
50080|0x00419DCA|Ahaha... I guess that makes me kinda happy to hear.
50081|0x00419E08|Ahaha... I guess that makes me~kinda happy to hear.
50082|0x00419E80|Her passionate pro-activeness pertaining to both club and romance sure~did its part.
50083|0x00419EDF|Her passionate pro-activeness~pertaining to both club and~romance sure did its part.
50084|0x00419F95|Stop talking about that already!

50086|0x0041A00F|Ten days had passed since Yume prohibited me from visiting her.
50087|0x0041A059|Ten days had passed since Yume~prohibited me from visiting~her.
50088|0x0041A0A8|During that period, Asuho and the others from the Astro Club went to~visit her several times.
50089|0x0041A110|During that period, Asuho and~the others from the Astro Club~went to visit her several~times.
50090|0x0041A17D|It seems they were able to hit it off without even the need for me to~introduce them to each other. Maybe that's because Hisakaki and~Kosame-san's father is Yume's assigned physician.
50091|0x0041A23F|It seems they were able to hit~it off without even the need~for me to introduce them to~each other. Maybe that's
50092|0x0041A2BF|On the one hand, I felt relieved knowing she had made friends, but on~the other, I still had some feelings of loneliness swirling around~inside me.

50112|0x0041A95D|...I'm kind of worried.
50113|0x0041A97F|...I'm kind of worried.
50114|0x0041A9A6|Seeing how I kept visiting her and even didn't attend club for that~purpose, I can understand why Asuho would be baffled.

50116|0x0041AAE9|Yume-san doesn't tell us anything either, even when we ask her...

50128|0x0041AF09|I directed my gaze out the window and absently wondered whether Yume~was also looking outside right now.

50149|0x0041B41E|Are you cold?
50150|0x0041B445|A little, yeah. Happens when winter comes.
50151|0x0041B47A|A little, yeah. Happens when~winter comes.
50152|0x0041B4B4|Come late November, snow can fall any time here in Hibarigasaki.

50160|0x0041B6C2|How come?

50162|0x0041B6F9|The stars are so incredibly bright during wintertime.
50163|0x0041B739|The stars are so incredibly~bright during wintertime.
50164|0x0041B79C|The cold air in winter is clean, resulting in a clear night sky that~is just perfect for stargazing.

50172|0x0041BAC6|That star there is super bright. The light looks pure white, too.

50178|0x0041BD2D|Where is Canis Minor?
50179|0x0041BD4D|Where is Canis Minor?
50180|0x0041BD7C|See those two constellations right below Orion, that look like they're~attendants waiting on him? Those are Canis Major and Canis Minor.
50181|0x0041BE0F|See those two constellations~right below Orion, that look~like they're attendants waiting~on him? Those are Canis Major

50184|0x0041BEDF|Servants attending to their master, basically.

50186|0x0041BF60|Oh, like me and Maggy?
50187|0x0041BF81|Oh, like me and Maggy?
50188|0x0041BFB1|Hmm, Maddo rests on your head a whole lot, so honestly I'd say it~might be the other way around.
50189|0x0041C01C|Hmm, Maddo rests on your head a~whole lot, so honestly I'd say~it might be the other way~around.
50190|0x0041C08C|In addition to those, you also have Auriga forming a magnificent~pentagon, and Gemini's Castor and Pollux which are known as the~heavenly twin stars.

50194|0x0041C22E|Those would be Auriga's Capella and Taurus' Aldebaran.
50195|0x0041C26F|Those would be Auriga's Capella~and Taurus' Aldebaran.
50196|0x0041C2BF|Both of them are first magnitude stars, and if you connect six of the~first-magnitude stars, you get the winter hexagon.
50197|0x0041C342|Both of them are first~magnitude stars, and if you~connect six of the~first-magnitude stars, you get
50198|0x0041C3C0|Wow. The starry sky of winter really is bright.
50199|0x0041C3FA|Wow. The starry sky of winter~really is bright.
50200|0x0041C439|Perhaps that was legitimate awe in her voice. Apart from that, I noted~that her breath was white despite her claim that she wasn't cold.

50210|0x0041C7AB|Neither Mare nor I mentioned it again afterwards.
50211|0x0041C7E7|Neither Mare nor I mentioned it~again afterwards.
50212|0x0041C828|It had no bearing on our private stargazing sessions. They were just~for the two of us.
50213|0x0041C88A|It had no bearing on our~private stargazing sessions.~They were just for the two of~us.

50215|0x0041C94B|No, actually, I guess I can't~quite say it's just the two of~us, huh?
50216|0x0041C9AA|...What?
50217|0x0041C9BD|...What?
50218|0x0041CA30|Maddo just happened to come flying over to us and land on Mare's head.
50219|0x0041CA81|Maddo just happened to come~flying over to us and land on~Mare's head.
50220|0x0041CB31|He wearily drooped his head down and put his wings to rest.

50228|0x0041CD15|Mare wordlessly hugged him to her chest.
50229|0x0041CD48|Mare wordlessly hugged him to~her chest.
50230|0x0041CD80|She searched for a good place to sit down, and then she put him down~to rest on her lap.
50231|0x0041CDE3|She searched for a good place~to sit down, and then she put~him down to rest on her lap.

50234|0x0041CEE7|She gently petted his head.
50235|0x0041CF0D|She gently petted his head.

50252|0x0041D310|...Maybe it's my fault.

50264|0x0041D5A2|Now he doesn't fly much at all... and even when he does, he comes back~right away...
50265|0x0041D601|Now he doesn't fly much at~all... and even when he does,~he comes back right away...

50525|0x00421D4C|...I decided to believe him.
50526|0x00421D82|Well, I just don't think Okaizumi-senpai considers astronomy to be~pointless.
50527|0x00421DDA|Well, I just don't think~Okaizumi-senpai considers~astronomy to be pointless.
50528|0x00421E51|And I ain't him, kid.

50532|0x00421F2B|And that got you thinkin' what I said was facade shit?
50533|0x00421F6C|And that got you thinkin' what~I said was facade shit?
50534|0x00421FBC|I'm proud of Okaizumi-senpai as our president. That's not a facade or~anything, but my genuine feelings.
50535|0x0042202F|I'm proud of Okaizumi-senpai as~our president. That's not a~facade or anything, but my~genuine feelings.

50537|0x00422125|Well, damn, count me jealous.~Being able to say all that~embarrassing shit aloud and~all.
50538|0x00422198|...Hisakaki tells me the same thing.
50539|0x004221C7|...Hisakaki tells me the same~thing.
50540|0x00422215|Take physics for example, kid. Basically just the study of the world~around us, uh-huh?

50542|0x004222DE|He started off like that languidly.
50543|0x0042230C|He started off like that~languidly.
50544|0x00422359|Then what about astronomy?
50545|0x0042237E|Then what about astronomy?
50546|0x004223B2|...Looking at it that way, I'd say it's a field that reconfirms just~how insignificant we humans are.

50578|0x004231CA|Astronomy taught us that all life will eventually perish without fail.

50580|0x00423271|I was speechless at this point.
50581|0x0042329B|I was speechless at this point.
50582|0x004232CA|Yet Okaizumi-senpai went on talking about it like it was nothing.

50736|0x00426571|Firmly believing they would meet again.
50737|0x004265A3|Firmly believing they would~meet again.

52897|0x0044ED94|Orihime and Hikoboshi got~married and were living a happy~life as a couple...
52898|0x0044EDFB|However, Orihime became too engrossed in her newfound married life and~completely ceased weaving clothes, which should've been her sacred~calling.
52899|0x0044EE98|However, Orihime became too~engrossed in her newfound~married life and completely~ceased weaving clothes, which
52900|0x0044EF21|For that, her father, who initially tolerated that, ascribing it to~them being newlyweds, gradually grew angry and ultimately took Orihime~back, away from Kengyuu's side.
52901|0x0044EFD6|For that, her father, who~initially tolerated that,~ascribing it to them being~newlyweds, gradually grew angry
52902|0x0044F05E|The God of the Heavens made Orihime live at the shores of the Milky~Way once again and ordered her to weave.
52903|0x0044F0D5|The God of the Heavens made~Orihime live at the shores of~the Milky Way once again and~ordered her to weave.
52904|0x0044F15B|He then told her that if she were to turn over a new leaf and approach~her work with the same zeal she'd once had, he would allow her to see~Kengyuu just once a year, on the night of the seventh day in the month~of July...
52905|0x0044F244|He then told her that if she~were to turn over a new leaf~and approach her work with the~same zeal she'd once had, he
52906|0x0044F2F2|And they all lived happily ever after.
52907|0x0044F323|And they all lived happily ever~after.
52908|0x0044F363|...Can you stop interrupting me and let me finish?
52909|0x0044F3A0|...Can you stop interrupting me~and let me finish?
52910|0x0044F3FB|Isn't it good enough they can see each other once a year?
52911|0x0044F43F|Isn't it good enough they can~see each other once a year?
52912|0x0044F494|I've been waiting for years on end...
52913|0x0044F4C4|I've been waiting for years on~end...
52914|0x0044F503|For whom?

52919|0x0044F5CB|You're still keeping that up?
52920|0x0044F604|I'll keep it up for as long as it takes. Which is, until you yield.
52921|0x0044F652|I'll keep it up for as long as~it takes. Which is, until you~yield.
52922|0x0044F6AF|Since when is this a competition...?
52923|0x0044F6DE|Since when is this a~competition...?
52924|0x0044F72B|You might be a guy, but I'm still the older one.

52928|0x0044F7FB|Yeah...
52929|0x0044F80D|Yeah...
52930|0x0044F84C|Orihime, having been separated from her beloved Kengyuu, thus grew~motivated by the prospect of reunion once a year and started to~diligently weave clothing after clothing again.
52931|0x0044F909|Orihime, having been separated~from her beloved Kengyuu, thus~grew motivated by the prospect~of reunion once a year and
52932|0x0044F99A|Kengyuu, too, took their promise of reunion to heart, and assiduously~immersed himself in his work as the two of them anticipated the 7th of~July.
52933|0x0044FA37|Kengyuu, too, took their~promise of reunion to heart,~and assiduously immersed~himself in his work as the two
52934|0x0044FABE|However, when it rains on that day, the rainwater makes the water~level of the Milky Way increase, thus rendering it impossible for~Orihime to cross over to the other shore where Hikoboshi is.
52935|0x0044FB89|However, when it rains on that~day, the rainwater makes the~water level of the Milky Way~increase, thus rendering it
52936|0x0044FC17|Standing on opposite shores of the Milky Way that separates them, the~two of them deeply grieve over not being able to reunite. All they can~do is gaze at the river surface as they weep...
52937|0x0044FCDE|Standing on opposite shores of~the Milky Way that separates~them, the two of them deeply~grieve over not being able to

52939|0x0044FDDE|After we were separated and I~was left with just our promise~of reunion in my heart, I~indeed had been zealous.
52940|0x0044FE5D|I learned many things about the stars.
52941|0x0044FE8E|I learned many things about the~stars.
52942|0x0044FEC4|I wanted to teach Yume the Tanabata legend.

52944|0x0044FF35|She became friends with me and made a promise with me, and so I, in~turn, wanted to recite the Tanabata legend to her.
52945|0x0044FFB6|She became friends with me and~made a promise with me, and so~I, in turn, wanted to recite~the Tanabata legend to her.
52946|0x00450048|And when the Milky Way becomes flooded from rain, unable to bear the~sight of the two lovers wallowing in sorrow, magpies come flying.~That's how it goes, right?
52947|0x004500F4|And when the Milky Way becomes~flooded from rain, unable to~bear the sight of the two~lovers wallowing in sorrow,
52948|0x0045017F|Sure is. They come flying as a flock.
52949|0x004501AF|Sure is. They come flying as a~flock.
52950|0x004501EE|Then, they each individually spread out their wings wide as can be,~and line up to form a bridge thus helping Orihime cross over to~Kengyuu's side.

52968|0x004505BE|The Tanabata legend isn't over yet.
52969|0x004505EC|The Tanabata legend isn't over~yet.

53623|0x0045C263|I couldn't just accept those~words, which sounded like she~was going to pass away soon.
53624|0x0045C2CA|If it's okay for me to lean on her, to freely borrow her bosom, then~Yume has to always be near me.
53625|0x0045C338|If it's okay for me to lean on~her, to freely borrow her~bosom, then Yume has to always~be near me.
53626|0x0045C3AB|After all, that's equivalent to a promise that she will stay with me.
53627|0x0045C3FB|After all, that's equivalent to~a promise that she will stay~with me.
53628|0x0045C469|...Yeah. You're right.

53632|0x0045C530|Yume's small smile.
53633|0x0045C54E|Yume's small smile.
53634|0x0045C571|I didn't just want to lean on her. I wanted to protect her smile.
53635|0x0045C5BD|I didn't just want to lean on~her. I wanted to protect her~smile.
53636|0x0045C60E|Even if that made her scold me not to push myself again...

53640|0x0045C729|I just couldn't accept those words.
53641|0x0045C757|I just couldn't accept those~words.
53642|0x0045C78A|And still, I was unable to say anything in response.
53643|0x0045C7C9|And still, I was unable to say~anything in response.

53645|0x0045C878|As someone who knows nothing~about the details of her~illness, I can't say things~thoughtlessly.
53646|0x0045C8E8|Unless she tells me about it, any words of encouragement I offer will~be nothing but mere consolation.
53647|0x0045C959|Unless she tells me about it,~any words of encouragement I~offer will be nothing but mere~consolation.

53650|0x0045CA2A|I can continue visiting her.
53651|0x0045CA51|I can continue visiting her.
53652|0x0045CA7D|Even if she bans me from visiting her again, I won't give up on that.
53653|0x0045CACD|Even if she bans me from~visiting her again, I won't~give up on that.

53665|0x0045CEE1|You said that Cygnus is part of~a triangle, right?
53666|0x0045CF2D|That would be one of the stars in Cygnus, Deneb. Together with Orihime~and Hikoboshi, those three stars are called the Summer Triangle.

53678|0x0045D34B|For some reason, she was upset.
53679|0x0045D375|For some reason, she was upset.
53680|0x0045D3AE|Oh, by the way, I was telling you about the Northern Cross, but~there's actually another one on the other side of the globe that's~called the Southern Cross.
53681|0x0045D456|Oh, by the way, I was telling~you about the Northern Cross,~but there's actually another~one on the other side of the

53878|0x00460340|Although that funny feeling felt a bit depraved.
53879|0x0046037B|Although that funny feeling~felt a bit depraved.
