55584|0x0047BBDE|The source from which all life is born.
55585|0x0047BC10|The source from which all life~is born.
55586|0x0047BC55|I was sent back, returned here, and thus fell into a deep slumber.
55587|0x0047BCA3|I was sent back, returned here,~and thus fell into a deep~slumber.
55588|0x0047BD04|I continued to sink into the chaos where life and death are jumbled~together as one, where existence and nonexistence no longer form a~pair of counterparts.

55590|0x0047BE43|Pulled in by the force of gravity, I continued sinking.
55591|0x0047BE86|Pulled in by the force of~gravity, I continued sinking.
55592|0x0047BEDC|Spinning round and round all the while.
55593|0x0047BF0F|Spinning round and round all~the while.
55594|0x0047BF55|Turning slowly, slowly, so very slowly, while inside that womb.
55595|0x0047BFA0|Turning slowly, slowly, so very~slowly, while inside that womb.
55596|0x0047BFFE|Since it was so warm here, so very warm, I almost forgot the very fact~that I was spinning here like this.

55598|0x0047C0FD|My memories almost fell from my grasp.

55600|0x0047C174|I almost let go of my memories with him.

55602|0x0047C1EF|The memories that define my very self.
55603|0x0047C221|The memories that define my~very self.
55604|0x0047C266|They lasted no more than a year, but they are irreplaceable~nonetheless. Without them, I would be nothing.

55606|0x0047C35C|If it hadn't been for those, I believe the individual that I am would~have returned to the uterus, my birthplace, at some point amidst the~spinning.

55612|0x0047C564|I successfully protected myself.
55613|0x0047C590|I successfully protected~myself.
55614|0x0047C5CF|But how long will I be able to do so?
55615|0x0047C600|But how long will I be able to~do so?
55616|0x0047C644|Will I be able to preserve myself for hundreds of years? Only a few?~Or will I not even be able to preserve myself beyond mere days?
55617|0x0047C6D4|Will I be able to preserve~myself for hundreds of years?~Only a few? Or will I not even~be able to preserve myself
55618|0x0047C765|Maybe, I've already reached the point where I'm not fully preserved~anymore.
55619|0x0047C7BD|Maybe, I've already reached the~point where I'm not fully~preserved anymore.
55620|0x0047C828|Still, there exists a future where I will be reborn.
55621|0x0047C868|Still, there exists a future~where I will be reborn.
55622|0x0047C8BB|I believe.
55623|0x0047C8D1|I believe.

55625|0x0047C922|It's not a prayer or a wish.

56199|0x00485CAC|I crouched down again.

56236|0x00486392|No!
56237|0x004863A1|No!
56238|0x004863E4|For some reason, I received yet another blow to the head.
56239|0x00486428|For some reason, I received yet~another blow to the head.
56240|0x004864A5|I-If I go out with you... that would make me a shotacon...
56241|0x004864EA|I-If I go out with you... that~would make me a shotacon...
56242|0x00486534|She was mulling over the same inner conflict as me.

56244|0x004865BF|...No, I just meant like going some place with me.
56245|0x004865FC|...No, I just meant like going~some place with me.
56246|0x0048663E|Mare tilted her head questioningly.
56247|0x0048666C|Mare tilted her head~questioningly.
56248|0x004866B7|...Where?
56249|0x004866CB|...Where?
56250|0x004866EE|The neighboring town's hospital.
56251|0x00486719|The neighboring town's~hospital.
56252|0x00486749|I still remembered her telling me a while back that while she couldn't~go anywhere far away, the neighboring town would be okay.

56258|0x0048690C|You're gonna... leave already...?
56259|0x00486938|You're gonna... leave~already...?
56260|0x00486969|Mare isn't one to speak her true feelings and desires.
56261|0x004869AA|Mare isn't one to speak her~true feelings and desires.
56262|0x004869F0|However, I could understand her feelings.
56263|0x00486A24|However, I could understand her~feelings.
56264|0x00486A67|I'm not going home. I'm just going over to the neighboring town.

56272|0x00486C15|So yeah, will you come along with me?
56273|0x00486C45|So yeah, will you come along~with me?
56274|0x00486C84|It seems like you went there by yourself before...
56275|0x00486CC1|It seems like you went there by~yourself before...
56276|0x00486D0D|But what about visiting Yume together this time?
56277|0x00486D48|But what about visiting Yume~together this time?
56278|0x00486DA0|......
56279|0x00486DB1|......
56280|0x00486DC7|After some initial surprise, Mare seemed to ponder the idea.
56281|0x00486E0E|After some initial surprise,~Mare seemed to ponder the idea.
56282|0x00486E72|...About how long would we be staying there?

56284|0x00486EEF|Not too long. Just around an hour probably.

56300|0x0048718B|The two of us swiftly departed from the lookout.
56301|0x004871C6|The two of us swiftly departed~from the lookout.
56302|0x0048724C|Mare was walking next to me.
56303|0x00487273|Mare was walking next to me.
56304|0x0048729F|The length of her stride was that of a child, but she still didn't~seem too hurried as she matched my pace.
56305|0x00487315|The length of her stride was~that of a child, but she still~didn't seem too hurried as she~matched my pace.
56306|0x00487390|It didn't look too strenuous for her. If anything, I was the one at~risk of getting left behind.
56307|0x004873FB|It didn't look too strenuous~for her. If anything, I was the~one at risk of getting left~behind.
56308|0x0048746B|It almost felt like she was wearing skates from the way she walked.
56309|0x004874B9|It almost felt like she was~wearing skates from the way she~walked.
56310|0x0048751C|It feels a bit weird.
56311|0x0048753C|It feels a bit weird.
56312|0x00487593|What do you mean?
56313|0x004875AF|What do you mean?
56314|0x004875DA|The two of us walking together.

56317|0x00487671|...You think so?
56318|0x0048769B|Yeah. We've never really spent time with each other anywhere beyond~the lookout.
56319|0x004876F6|Yeah. We've never really spent~time with each other anywhere~beyond the lookout.
56320|0x00487756|We had met at other places too, but at those times we hadn't walked~together like this.
56321|0x004877B8|We had met at other places too,~but at those times we hadn't~walked together like this.
56322|0x00487829|You walk pretty fast.
56323|0x00487849|You walk pretty fast.
56324|0x00487883|You think so?
56325|0x0048789B|You think so?
56326|0x004878C2|Yeah.
56327|0x004878D2|Yeah.
56328|0x004878FF|Well, I am a shinigami after all.
56329|0x0048792B|Well, I am a shinigami after~all.
56330|0x0048795C|She boasted.
56331|0x00487973|She boasted.
56332|0x004879A7|...Sorry, correction. I meant, it is me after all.
56333|0x004879E4|...Sorry, correction. I meant,~it is me after all.
56334|0x00487A26|I guess that was her way of showing she wasn't fixated on being a~shinigami.
56335|0x00487A7D|I guess that was her way of~showing she wasn't fixated on~being a shinigami.
56336|0x00487AE3|I don't think there's really anything wrong with staying a shinigami.
56337|0x00487B33|I don't think there's really~anything wrong with staying a~shinigami.
56338|0x00487BA0|...You don't?
56339|0x00487BB8|...You don't?
56340|0x00487BDF|Yeah. No reason to force yourself to change that. Whether you're a~shinigami or not, you're still Mare.
56341|0x00487C51|Yeah. No reason to force~yourself to change that.~Whether you're a shinigami or~not, you're still Mare.
56342|0x00487CE0|...Really?

56350|0x00487E3E|...Yeah.
56351|0x00487E51|...Yeah.
56352|0x00487E69|Mare then muttered, as if to confirm it to herself.

56354|0x00487F02|I'm a shinigami...

56356|0x00487F59|A shinigami that reaps you...
56357|0x00487F81|A shinigami that reaps you...
56358|0x00487FAE|I didn't really need to be reaped, though.

56371|0x00488278|Shinigami aren't known or~loved.
56372|0x004882A8|By this point, we were just going in circles.

56374|0x00488327|Oh well, all right.
56375|0x00488345|Oh well, all right.
56376|0x0048838B|Shinigami aren't all right.
56377|0x004883B1|Shinigami aren't all right.

56379|0x0048848D|As we came near the school~gate, I started to spot~students here and there on~their way home from school.
56380|0x00488506|All of their gazes were glued on this strange girl who had appeared~from the top of the hill.
56381|0x0048856E|All of their gazes were glued~on this strange girl who had~appeared from the top of the~hill.
56382|0x004885DB|Their attention was directed in particular at Mare's huge scythe.
56383|0x00488627|Their attention was directed in~particular at Mare's huge~scythe.
56384|0x00488682|...Hm, come to think of it.
56385|0x004886A8|...Hm, come to think of it.
56386|0x004886D3|It had totally slipped my mind, probably because I had never walked~around outside the lookout with Mare like this.
56387|0x00488751|It had totally slipped my mind,~probably because I had never~walked around outside the~lookout with Mare like this.
56388|0x004887D4|At this rate, she was likely to be arrested for violating the Swords~and Firearms Control Law.
56389|0x0048883D|At this rate, she was likely to~be arrested for violating the~Swords and Firearms Control~Law.
56390|0x004888DB|...There are people.
56391|0x004888FA|...There are people.
56392|0x00488942|Mare hid behind my back when she became the center of attention.
56393|0x0048898D|Mare hid behind my back when~she became the center of~attention.
56394|0x004889DD|However, she couldn't fully conceal the scythe behind me. It stuck out~above my head.
56395|0x00488A3D|However, she couldn't fully~conceal the scythe behind me.~It stuck out above my head.
56396|0x00488AAC|Hey, Mare?

56405|0x00488BEB|...Leave it?
56406|0x00488C11|Yeah. Walking around with that thing is a bad idea.
56407|0x00488C4F|Yeah. Walking around with that~thing is a bad idea.
56408|0x00488CAA|It's not difficult for me to carry it.
56409|0x00488CDB|It's not difficult for me to~carry it.
56410|0x00488D1B|That might be the case for you, but it's dangerous, you know what I~mean?
56411|0x00488D6F|That might be the case for you,~but it's dangerous, you know~what I mean?
56412|0x00488DE0|No, it's perfectly safe.
56413|0x00488E03|No, it's perfectly safe.
56414|0x00488E35|But all the people around us don't know that.
56415|0x00488E6D|But all the people around us~don't know that.
56416|0x00488EC2|Not my problem.
56417|0x00488EDC|Not my problem.
56418|0x00488F05|Well, look at it this way. If you keep it with you, people will keep~staring at you like they're doing right now.
56419|0x00488F81|Well, look at it this way. If~you keep it with you, people~will keep staring at you like~they're doing right now.
56420|0x00489002|Using my body as a protective wall, she carefully peeked out to~examine the situation. She met a student's gaze and immediately hid~again.

56432|0x004892FB|Mare tightly hugged her scythe.
56433|0x00489325|Mare tightly hugged her scythe.
56434|0x00489354|I could tell that it was really important to her, since I could sense~her strong determination.
56435|0x004893BE|I could tell that it was really~important to her, since I could~sense her strong determination.
56436|0x0048942D|But we couldn't get on the train with that thing.
56437|0x00489469|But we couldn't get on the~train with that thing.
56438|0x004894C2|...You-kun, you look troubled.
56439|0x004894EB|...You-kun, you look troubled.
56440|0x00489519|It must have showed on my face.
56441|0x00489543|It must have showed on my face.
56442|0x0048958A|I just can't carry it around, right?
56443|0x004895B9|I just can't carry it around,~right?
56444|0x004895ED|Mare let go of the scythe's shaft.
56445|0x0048961A|Mare let go of the scythe's~shaft.
56446|0x004896BC|The scythe then hovered in the air, defying gravity, before gradually~turning transparent.
56447|0x00489721|The scythe then hovered in the~air, defying gravity, before~gradually turning transparent.
56448|0x004897A7|Amidst the clamoring voices of several students, the scythe completely~disappeared.
56449|0x00489805|Amidst the clamoring voices of~several students, the scythe~completely disappeared.
56450|0x00489868|I never really noticed that Mare was sometimes holding the scythe and~sometimes hiding it.
56451|0x004898CD|I never really noticed that~Mare was sometimes holding the~scythe and sometimes hiding it.
56452|0x00489937|This was the first time I'd actually witnessed the process for real.
56453|0x00489986|This was the first time I'd~actually witnessed the process~for real.
56454|0x00489A40|What did you just do?
56455|0x00489A60|What did you just do?
56456|0x00489A9D|I made it so that humans won't interfere with it.
56457|0x00489AD9|I made it so that humans won't~interfere with it.
56458|0x00489B24|...You mean you made it invisible?

57765|0x0049EDC3|What?
57766|0x0049EDD8|I wanted to ask her, but I couldn't put the question into words.
57767|0x0049EE23|I wanted to ask her, but I~couldn't put the question into~words.
57768|0x0049EE73|Finding out wouldn't let me to do anything about it anyway, and above~all, I was afraid of finding out.
57769|0x0049EEE5|Finding out wouldn't let me to~do anything about it anyway,~and above all, I was afraid of~finding out.
57770|0x0049EF5C|I could only wait for Yume to tell me of her own volition.

57772|0x0049EFF5|...Is your tutor coming?
57773|0x0049F018|...Is your tutor coming?
57774|0x0049F05A|I wouldn't know. We don't have any set days Fairy comes or anything.
57775|0x0049F0A9|I wouldn't know. We don't have~any set days Fairy comes or~anything.
57776|0x0049F117|Maybe that person isn't coming today because you're here.
57777|0x0049F15B|Maybe that person isn't coming~today because you're here.
57778|0x0049F1BE|And even if Fairy does come, I have no idea whether you two could~meet.
57779|0x0049F210|And even if Fairy does come, I~have no idea whether you two~could meet.
57780|0x0049F291|The time was nearly eight o'clock.

57784|0x0049F34B|Yume told me that all lights had to be out at nine.
57785|0x0049F389|Yume told me that all lights~had to be out at nine.
57786|0x0049F431|Are you going to get ready for bed soon?
57787|0x0049F464|Are you going to get ready for~bed soon?
57788|0x0049F4B6|Hm, I guess. I'll brush my teeth, lock the window, and shut the~curtains. Other than that, since today isn't a bath day, I won't have~to bathe, so...
57789|0x0049F556|Hm, I guess. I'll brush my~teeth, lock the window, and~shut the curtains. Other than~that, since today isn't a bath

57816|0x0049FB60|If you say you want to wipe my body for me, just know that I'll ban~you from visiting me ever again.
57817|0x0049FBCF|If you say you want to wipe my~body for me, just know that~I'll ban you from visiting me~ever again.
57818|0x0049FC4D|...Hey, Yume.
57819|0x0049FC65|...Hey, Yume.
57820|0x0049FC82|Since I wasn't used to this sort of thing, I needed to gather my~courage to say it.
57821|0x0049FCE0|Since I wasn't used to this~sort of thing, I needed to~gather my courage to say it.
57822|0x0049FD4D|You said I could lean on you... right...?
57823|0x0049FD81|You said I could lean on you...~right...?
57824|0x0049FDBA|Yume cocked her head to the side, with a curious look on her face.

57832|0x0049FF58|I did say that.
57833|0x0049FF72|I did say that.
57834|0x0049FF9B|In that case...
57835|0x0049FFB5|In that case...
57836|0x0049FFEE|Want me to embrace you again?
57837|0x004A0016|Want me to embrace you again?
57838|0x004A0043|I shook my head.

57848|0x004A0200|I mean something else.
57849|0x004A0221|I mean something else.
57850|0x004A0261|No watching either.
57851|0x004A027F|No watching either.
57852|0x004A02AC|......
57853|0x004A02BD|......
57854|0x004A02ED|...Why did you fall silent?
57855|0x004A0313|...Why did you fall silent?
57856|0x004A033E|A scowl appeared on Yume's face.
57857|0x004A0369|A scowl appeared on Yume's~face.
57858|0x004A03B3|Listen. You can't do anything to me.
57859|0x004A03E2|Listen. You can't do anything~to me.
57860|0x004A0420|Why not?
57861|0x004A0433|Why not?
57862|0x004A0465|I need to be the one to do things for you.
57863|0x004A049A|I need to be the one to do~things for you.
57864|0x004A04DE|Because I have to be the one to lean on you?
57865|0x004A0515|Because I have to be the one to~lean on you?
57866|0x004A056B|Yep.

57870|0x004A05D3|So what do you want?
57871|0x004A05F2|So what do you want?
57872|0x004A0620|A kiss.
57873|0x004A0632|A kiss.
57874|0x004A0663|......
57875|0x004A0674|......
57876|0x004A0694|Would you give me a kiss?
57877|0x004A06B8|Would you give me a kiss?
57878|0x004A06EF|Yume cast her eyes down.
57879|0x004A0712|Yume cast her eyes down.
57880|0x004A0754|...You want a kiss?
57881|0x004A0772|...You want a kiss?
57882|0x004A079F|Yeah.
57883|0x004A07AF|Yeah.
57884|0x004A07C4|I made an effort to collect myself.
57885|0x004A07F2|I made an effort to collect~myself.
57886|0x004A0825|It would make the situation come to nothing if I got embarrassed here.
57887|0x004A0876|It would make the situation~come to nothing if I got~embarrassed here.
57888|0x004A08CC|Yume placed her hand on the bed.
57889|0x004A08F7|Yume placed her hand on the~bed.
57890|0x004A0941|Do you want to sit down... next to me?
57891|0x004A0972|Do you want to sit down... next~to me?
57892|0x004A09DB|As I sat down next to her, the bed springs creaked.
57893|0x004A0A19|As I sat down next to her, the~bed springs creaked.
57894|0x004A0A5C|Our shoulders touched.
57895|0x004A0A7D|Our shoulders touched.
57896|0x004A0AE6|You've actually become able to say the things you want now...
57897|0x004A0B2E|You've actually become able to~say the things you want now...
57898|0x004A0B7B|When Yume turned to face me, I was close enough to feel her breath.
57899|0x004A0BC9|When Yume turned to face me, I~was close enough to feel her~breath.
57900|0x004A0C1C|That's how very close we were to each other.
57901|0x004A0C53|That's how very close we were~to each other.
57902|0x004A0CA9|All right then...
57903|0x004A0CC5|All right then...
57904|0x004A0CE6|Yume's face drew in even closer.
57905|0x004A0D11|Yume's face drew in even~closer.
57906|0x004A0D4D|I wonder, have I been a good big sister for you...?
57907|0x004A0D8B|I wonder, have I been a good~big sister for you...?
57908|0x004A0DCE|Yume's lips headed toward my forehead.
57909|0x004A0DFF|Yume's lips headed toward my~forehead.
57910|0x004A0E35|It turned out to be a kiss on my forehead.
57911|0x004A0E6A|It turned out to be a kiss on~my forehead.
57912|0x004A0EA4|A childish kiss.
57913|0x004A0EBF|A childish kiss.
57914|0x004A0EDF|So I grabbed Yume's shoulders.
57915|0x004A0F08|So I grabbed Yume's shoulders.
57916|0x004A0F62|Huh...?!
57917|0x004A0F75|Huh...?!
57918|0x004A0F8D|The moment Yume glanced downward, I stole them.
57919|0x004A0FC7|The moment Yume glanced~downward, I stole them.
57920|0x004A101C|I stole Yume's lips.
57921|0x004A103B|I stole Yume's lips.
57922|0x004A10AC|It was only a light peck on her lips.
57923|0x004A10DC|It was only a light peck on her~lips.
57924|0x004A1111|Still though, it was a more intense kiss than one on the forehead.
57925|0x004A115E|Still though, it was a more~intense kiss than one on the~forehead.
57926|0x004A11B0|I felt like our connection had deepened.
57927|0x004A11E3|I felt like our connection had~deepened.
57928|0x004A1227|You-kun...
57929|0x004A123C|You-kun...
57930|0x004A1260|......
57931|0x004A1271|......
57932|0x004A12A1|...Aren't you gonna apologize?
57933|0x004A12CA|...Aren't you gonna apologize?
57934|0x004A1302|Nope.
57935|0x004A1312|Nope.
57936|0x004A1333|Why not...?
57937|0x004A1349|Why not...?
57938|0x004A136E|Well, I'll apologize if that upset you.
57939|0x004A13A0|Well, I'll apologize if that~upset you.
57940|0x004A13F1|...It did upset me. Yep, I'm really mad.
57941|0x004A1424|...It did upset me. Yep, I'm~really mad.
57942|0x004A1466|Can I kiss you one more time?
57943|0x004A148E|Can I kiss you one more time?
57944|0x004A14D5|...Still no apology. You big fat liar.
57945|0x004A1506|...Still no apology. You big~fat liar.
57946|0x004A1546|Okay, fine, I apologize. Sorry about that. Now can I kiss you again?
57947|0x004A1595|Okay, fine, I apologize. Sorry~about that. Now can I kiss you~again?
57948|0x004A1603|Where's the logic in that...
57949|0x004A162A|Where's the logic in that...
57950|0x004A1676|I pulled her towards me.
57951|0x004A1699|I pulled her towards me.
57952|0x004A16C1|It took almost no force at all since she was light as a feather.
57953|0x004A170C|It took almost no force at all~since she was light as a~feather.
57954|0x004A175C|It pained me to feel how light she was.
57955|0x004A178E|It pained me to feel how light~she was.
57956|0x004A17DF|...!
57957|0x004A17EE|...!
57958|0x004A1802|As I wrapped her up in my arms, a jolt of surprise ran up Yume's~spine.
57959|0x004A1854|As I wrapped her up in my arms,~a jolt of surprise ran up~Yume's spine.
57960|0x004A18B7|You... can't...
57961|0x004A18D1|You... can't...
57962|0x004A18FA|......
57963|0x004A190B|......
57964|0x004A192D|This is... the wrong way around...
57965|0x004A195A|This is... the wrong way~around...
57966|0x004A1998|I can't be your big sister like this...
57967|0x004A19CA|I can't be your big sister like~this...
57968|0x004A1A07|While holding her in my arms, I gently pushed her down on the bed.
57969|0x004A1A54|While holding her in my arms, I~gently pushed her down on the~bed.
57970|0x004A1AF0|When I woke up, the warmth in my arms had disappeared.
57971|0x004A1B31|When I woke up, the warmth in~my arms had disappeared.
57972|0x004A1B7C|After fumbling around and finding nothing, I sat up.
57973|0x004A1BBB|After fumbling around and~finding nothing, I sat up.
57974|0x004A1C2A|I looked around and quickly found her.
57975|0x004A1C5B|I looked around and quickly~found her.
57976|0x004A1CB1|Yume was standing at the window.
57977|0x004A1CDC|Yume was standing at the~window.
57978|0x004A1D0C|It seemed like she was gazing outside.
57979|0x004A1D3D|It seemed like she was gazing~outside.
57980|0x004A1D73|Just like I'd seen her do on each of my visits. Maybe it was something~like a daily routine to her.
57981|0x004A1DE1|Just like I'd seen her do on~each of my visits. Maybe it was~something like a daily routine~to her.
57982|0x004A1E7E|Since the window was on the west side, the sun wasn't visible, but the~surface of the sea outside sparkled with sunlight.
57983|0x004A1F02|Since the window was on the~west side, the sun wasn't~visible, but the surface of the~sea outside sparkled with
57984|0x004A1F81|Come evening, the room would be filled with red light.
57985|0x004A1FC2|Come evening, the room would be~filled with red light.
57986|0x004A206A|Ah...!
57987|0x004A207B|Ah...!
57988|0x004A2091|When Yume turned around, our eyes met.
57989|0x004A20C2|When Yume turned around, our~eyes met.
57990|0x004A20F8|I couldn't clearly make out her expression, since the light from the~window behind her casted a shadow over her face, but I thought I saw a~shy smile appear on her face when she saw me.
57991|0x004A21BC|I couldn't clearly make out her~expression, since the light~from the window behind her~casted a shadow over her face,
57992|0x004A225B|Phew, that was a close call... Yep. Very close indeed.
57993|0x004A229C|Phew, that was a close call...~Yep. Very close indeed.
57994|0x004A22FC|A hair's breadth away from disaster, you could say.
57995|0x004A233A|A hair's breadth away from~disaster, you could say.
57996|0x004A2387|...What is?
57997|0x004A239D|...What is?
57998|0x004A23D2|Well, I was wiping my body with a towel just now.
57999|0x004A240E|Well, I was wiping my body with~a towel just now.
58000|0x004A244F|She looked embarrassed after admitting that.
58001|0x004A2486|She looked embarrassed after~admitting that.
58002|0x004A24DC|I figured I'd get it done and over with while you were asleep.
58003|0x004A2525|I figured I'd get it done and~over with while you were~asleep.
58004|0x004A2573|...So, in other words, she took off her pajamas right here, next to~me.
58005|0x004A25C5|...So, in other words, she took~off her pajamas right here,~next to me.
58006|0x004A2636|I wasn't able to do it last night because of a certain someone.
58007|0x004A2680|I wasn't able to do it last~night because of a certain~someone.
58008|0x004A26D9|...It's my fault?
58009|0x004A26F5|...It's my fault?
58010|0x004A2730|Am I wrong?
58011|0x004A2746|Am I wrong?
58012|0x004A2761|She wasn't wrong.
58013|0x004A277D|She wasn't wrong.
58014|0x004A27A8|But what need is there to be shy about me seeing your body now?
58015|0x004A27F2|But what need is there to be~shy about me seeing your body~now?
58016|0x004A2841|Yume blushed.
58017|0x004A2859|Yume blushed.
58018|0x004A2890|...Have a little tact, would you?
58019|0x004A28BC|...Have a little tact, would~you?
58020|0x004A28F7|I'm just kidding.
58021|0x004A2913|I'm just kidding.
58022|0x004A294E|Geez, You-kun, you're still just as bad with girls as when you were a~kid.
58023|0x004A29A3|Geez, You-kun, you're still~just as bad with girls as when~you were a kid.
58024|0x004A2A07|Look, I said it was a joke.
58025|0x004A2A2D|Look, I said it was a joke.
58026|0x004A2A72|Maybe I should go back to pretending we never met in the past.
58027|0x004A2ABB|Maybe I should go back to~pretending we never met in the~past.
58028|0x004A2B13|...I'm sorry, Yume.
58029|0x004A2B31|...I'm sorry, Yume.

58540|0x004AB0D0|To me, there seemed to be a certain envy contained in Yume's gaze.

58542|0x004AB1B5|How about we go outside?
58543|0x004AB1D8|How about we go outside?
58544|0x004AB235|Hearing my question, Yume turned towards me with a surprised look.
58545|0x004AB282|Hearing my question, Yume~turned towards me with a~surprised look.
58546|0x004AB2DE|We could sneak outside, like the other day. How about that?
58547|0x004AB324|We could sneak outside, like~the other day. How about that?
58548|0x004AB389|...At night, you mean?

58550|0x004AB3DA|Nope. This time during daytime.
58551|0x004AB404|Nope. This time during daytime.
58552|0x004AB43F|During the day...?
58553|0x004AB45C|During the day...?
58554|0x004AB488|It's such good weather, I bet it feels great outside. If you're~feeling up to it, we could maybe go on a walk or something.

58558|0x004AB603|...That's not possible.
58559|0x004AB625|...That's not possible.
58560|0x004AB656|Yes, it is.
58561|0x004AB66C|Yes, it is.
58562|0x004AB6A1|Nurses call out to me when I walk through the hallways, and when I try~to exit through the entrance, the security comes at me.

58564|0x004AB7BE|I have a way around that.
58565|0x004AB7E2|I have a way around that.
58566|0x004AB825|...Does it involve kidnapping me?
58567|0x004AB851|...Does it involve kidnapping~me?
58568|0x004AB88C|Bingo. I have a secret plan to steal you away from the hospital.
58569|0x004AB8D7|Bingo. I have a secret plan to~steal you away from the~hospital.
58570|0x004AB933|......
58571|0x004AB944|......
58572|0x004AB964|What do you say, Yume? Are you in or out?
58573|0x004AB998|What do you say, Yume? Are you~in or out?
58574|0x004AB9DB|Will you seize the hand of your kidnapper, or choose not to...?
58575|0x004ABA25|Will you seize the hand of your~kidnapper, or choose not to...?
58576|0x004ABA74|I held out my hand to her.
58577|0x004ABA99|I held out my hand to her.
58578|0x004ABADD|...You're really something.
58579|0x004ABB03|...You're really something.
58580|0x004ABB2E|Yume sounded like she was exasperated with me.
58581|0x004ABB67|Yume sounded like she was~exasperated with me.
58582|0x004ABBBF|Boys will be boys, as they say.
58583|0x004ABBE9|Boys will be boys, as they say.
58584|0x004ABC18|She took my hand.

58588|0x004ABD34|I left Yume's hospital for the time being.
58589|0x004ABD69|I left Yume's hospital for the~time being.
58590|0x004ABDA3|There were certain things I needed to do if I wanted to take Yume~outside.
58591|0x004ABDF8|There were certain things I~needed to do if I wanted to~take Yume outside.
58592|0x004ABE52|It was still before noon, just one hour shy of when visiting hours~start.
58593|0x004ABEA6|It was still before noon, just~one hour shy of when visiting~hours start.
58594|0x004ABEFF|Since I had on my school uniform, I was concerned about someone~questioning me as I walked through the hospital, but nothing of the~sort happened.
58595|0x004ABF9C|Since I had on my school~uniform, I was concerned about~someone questioning me as I~walked through the hospital,
58596|0x004AC01C|Since there are hardly any people that go through the west ward's~hallways in the first place, I didn't even pass by anyone.
58597|0x004AC0A3|Since there are hardly any~people that go through the west~ward's hallways in the first~place, I didn't even pass by
58598|0x004AC127|I decided not to deal with the central ward, so I exited the hospital~through the west ward's entrance.
58599|0x004AC199|I decided not to deal with the~central ward, so I exited the~hospital through the west~ward's entrance.
58600|0x004AC239|I then proceeded to make a few purchases at a store by the nearest~station, and then I promptly made my way back to the hospital with my~preparations complete.

58603|0x004AC3A4|By the time I got back,~visiting hours had started.
58604|0x004AC3E7|So I headed over to Yume's hospital room without worry.

58606|0x004AC4C7|Ah... You-kun.

58608|0x004AC4FE|Yume was in the middle of eating lunch.

58610|0x004AC5C4|Welcome back.
58611|0x004AC5DC|Welcome back.
58612|0x004AC603|Thanks.
58613|0x004AC615|Thanks.
58614|0x004AC646|You had me thinking you might not be coming back.
58615|0x004AC682|You had me thinking you might~not be coming back.
58616|0x004AC6CD|Sorry it took me so long.
58617|0x004AC6F1|Sorry it took me so long.
58618|0x004AC734|...Huh?
58619|0x004AC746|...Huh?
58620|0x004AC75D|Yume finally noticed.
58621|0x004AC77D|Yume finally noticed.
58622|0x004AC7BC|You changed out of your uniform.
58623|0x004AC7E7|You changed out of your~uniform.
58624|0x004AC821|Yeah, I figured I might as well.
58625|0x004AC84C|Yeah, I figured I might as~well.
58626|0x004AC888|Did you stop back home?
58627|0x004AC8AA|Did you stop back home?
58628|0x004AC8DB|Nope, I bought these at a store by the station.
58629|0x004AC915|Nope, I bought these at a store~by the station.
58630|0x004AC954|Since I naturally wouldn't find the items I needed at the hospital~store here, I made my way over to the shopping area by the station.
58631|0x004AC9E5|Since I naturally wouldn't find~the items I needed at the~hospital store here, I made my~way over to the shopping area
58632|0x004ACA6B|After changing into these clothes in the store's dressing room, I went~and stuffed my uniform inside a luggage locker at the station.
58633|0x004ACAFB|After changing into these~clothes in the store's dressing~room, I went and stuffed my~uniform inside a luggage locker
58634|0x004ACB80|My biggest worry was the fact that it was a school day. Walking around~town in a uniform while school was still in session was, needless to~say, a bit conspicuous.
58635|0x004ACC2E|My biggest worry was the fact~that it was a school day.~Walking around town in a~uniform while school was still

58644|0x004ACE91|Yep. The goods we'll use to kidnap you.
58645|0x004ACEC3|Yep. The goods we'll use to~kidnap you.
58646|0x004ACF14|So, um, are you trying to say I'm gonna have to get into this and~you'll carry me off?
58647|0x004ACF75|So, um, are you trying to say~I'm gonna have to get into this~and you'll carry me off?
58648|0x004ACFE5|...Well, naturally you wouldn't fit in something this small.
58649|0x004AD02C|...Well, naturally you wouldn't~fit in something this small.
58650|0x004AD092|Oh, did you get anything to eat?

58656|0x004AD1AB|Yume held out the tray to me.
58657|0x004AD1D3|Yume held out the tray to me.
58658|0x004AD200|It was her lunch, and she only ate half of it.

58660|0x004AD281|...Are you gonna bite me if I say no?
58661|0x004AD2B1|...Are you gonna bite me if I~say no?
58662|0x004AD300|Yep.
58663|0x004AD30F|Yep.
58664|0x004AD355|Yume positioned herself next to me and wrapped her arms around my~neck.
58665|0x004AD3A7|Yume positioned herself next to~me and wrapped her arms around~my neck.
58666|0x004AD428|After which she latched herself onto me.
58667|0x004AD45B|After which she latched herself~onto me.
58668|0x004AD49F|I'll bite you all over, just like this...

58671|0x004AD554|As she whispered that next to~my ear, I sensed her breathing.
58672|0x004AD5A1|I put my arms around her back.

58674|0x004AD631|Mmh...
58675|0x004AD642|Mmh...
58676|0x004AD658|Yume's breasts squished up against my chest.
58677|0x004AD68F|Yume's breasts squished up~against my chest.
58678|0x004AD6E1|We kissed.
58679|0x004AD6F6|We kissed.

58684|0x004AD7DA|...Can't I just have a little?
58685|0x004AD803|...Can't I just have a little?
58686|0x004AD83D|No means no...
58687|0x004AD856|No means no...
58688|0x004AD89F|Yume gently pulled away from me.
58689|0x004AD8CA|Yume gently pulled away from~me.

58694|0x004AD9B8|How are you feeling?
58695|0x004AD9D7|How are you feeling?
58696|0x004ADA15|Good enough... no worries.
58697|0x004ADA3A|Good enough... no worries.
58698|0x004ADA6E|Can you get changed?
58699|0x004ADA8D|Can you get changed?
58700|0x004ADACB|Sure, though I only have that one dress.
58701|0x004ADAFE|Sure, though I only have that~one dress.
58702|0x004ADB40|That's fine. Since we'll be going outside, we can go buy you some~clothes anyway.
58703|0x004ADB9C|That's fine. Since we'll be~going outside, we can go buy~you some clothes anyway.
58704|0x004ADBFD|Yume didn't answer.

58706|0x004ADC48|I'll gladly buy them for you as a present or something.

58712|0x004ADD7B|I opened the bag and said...
58713|0x004ADDA2|I opened the bag and said...
58714|0x004ADDD8|Once you get changed, put these on as well.
58715|0x004ADE0E|Once you get changed, put these~on as well.
58716|0x004ADE49|I took out a broad brimmed hat and a jacket, and I passed them to~Yume.
58717|0x004ADE9B|I took out a broad brimmed hat~and a jacket, and I passed them~to Yume.
58718|0x004ADF17|The plan was simple.
58719|0x004ADF36|The plan was simple.
58720|0x004ADF5A|Wearing the hat would allow her to conceal her face by hanging low,~and the jacket would also switch up her appearance compared to what~the staff was used to. With the help of that disguise, she could sneak~out of the hospital.
58721|0x004AE048|Wearing the hat would allow her~to conceal her face by hanging~low, and the jacket would also~switch up her appearance
58722|0x004AE0CE|After I ate the lunch Yume had left for me, I waited outside in the~hallway until she had changed.
58723|0x004AE13B|After I ate the lunch Yume had~left for me, I waited outside~in the hallway until she had~changed.
58724|0x004AE1AD|With all preparations complete, we walked out together.
58725|0x004AE1EF|With all preparations complete,~we walked out together.
58726|0x004AE236|On the way to the entrance we passed by several people, but we acted~as composed and natural as possible.
58727|0x004AE2AA|On the way to the entrance we~passed by several people, but~we acted as composed and~natural as possible.
58728|0x004AE323|Nobody stopped us on the way, and we easily left the hospital.
58729|0x004AE36C|Nobody stopped us on the way,~and we easily left the~hospital.
58730|0x004AE43B|Wow... We really managed to get out.
58731|0x004AE46A|Wow... We really managed to get~out.
58732|0x004AE49E|I stowed the hat and jacket in the bag, and then I took a moment to~catch my breath.
58733|0x004AE4FD|I stowed the hat and jacket in~the bag, and then I took a~moment to catch my breath.
58734|0x004AE581|Looks like your little disguise plan went through without a hitch,~huh?
58735|0x004AE5D3|Looks like your little disguise~plan went through without a~hitch, huh?
58736|0x004AE634|Yeah, it honestly went a lot better than I thought it would.
58737|0x004AE67B|Yeah, it honestly went a lot~better than I thought it would.
58738|0x004AE6E1|Boy, you're telling me. My heart was pounding like crazy when we~passed through the entrance hall. I was just waiting for the security~guard to come and stop us.
58739|0x004AE78D|Boy, you're telling me. My~heart was pounding like crazy~when we passed through the~entrance hall. I was just
58740|0x004AE80A|He did look at us, but ultimately he didn't do anything.
58741|0x004AE84D|He did look at us, but~ultimately he didn't do~anything.
58742|0x004AE8AF|Maybe they need to work on their security a bit.
58743|0x004AE8EA|Maybe they need to work on~their security a bit.
58744|0x004AE934|Come to think of it, the security at Hibari High is lax like this,~too.
58745|0x004AE986|Come to think of it, the~security at Hibari High is lax~like this, too.
58746|0x004AE9F7|Maybe there's just something about Hibarigasaki, you know?
58747|0x004AEA3C|Maybe there's just something~about Hibarigasaki, you know?
58748|0x004AEA90|Well, I still think they should try to do better.
58749|0x004AEACC|Well, I still think they should~try to do better.
58750|0x004AEB27|Even so, I quite like this town. It's just so peaceful and quiet~compared to the city.
58751|0x004AEB88|Even so, I quite like this~town. It's just so peaceful and~quiet compared to the city.
58752|0x004AEBEE|It was the same for me.
58753|0x004AEC10|It was the same for me.
58754|0x004AEC4D|Life here feels nice and relaxed, like time itself moves at a slower~pace.
58755|0x004AECA2|Life here feels nice and~relaxed, like time itself moves~at a slower pace.
58756|0x004AECFC|Honestly, I wouldn't even mind if it stopped completely.
58757|0x004AED3F|Honestly, I wouldn't even mind~if it stopped completely.
58758|0x004AED87|Nothing would be better than being able to enjoy life like this with~Yume for eternity.
58759|0x004AEDE9|Nothing would be better than~being able to enjoy life like~this with Yume for eternity.
58760|0x004AEEA3|All right then, Yume.
58761|0x004AEEC3|All right then, Yume.
58762|0x004AEEE8|I held out my hand to her.
58763|0x004AEF0D|I held out my hand to her.
58764|0x004AEF41|I'll take you wherever you want.
58765|0x004AEF6C|I'll take you wherever you~want.
58766|0x004AEFB6|...Okay.
58767|0x004AEFC9|...Okay.
58768|0x004AEFE1|Our hands came together.
58769|0x004AF004|Our hands came together.
58770|0x004AF046|You know, it's almost like I'm Rapunzel, and you're the prince that~rescues me from the castle.
58771|0x004AF0B0|You know, it's almost like I'm~Rapunzel, and you're the prince~that rescues me from the~castle.
58772|0x004AF13E|The place Yume wanted to go to was the lookout.
58773|0x004AF178|The place Yume wanted to go to~was the lookout.
58774|0x004AF1B7|I proposed going by taxi in that case, but Yume turned the offer down.
58775|0x004AF208|I proposed going by taxi in~that case, but Yume turned the~offer down.
58776|0x004AF25E|I was worried about her stamina getting up that big hill, but still,~Yume wouldn't give up.
58777|0x004AF2C4|I was worried about her stamina~getting up that big hill, but~still, Yume wouldn't give up.
58778|0x004AF32F|So we got on a train at the station and headed to that destination.
58779|0x004AF37D|So we got on a train at the~station and headed to that~destination.
58780|0x004AF405|You sure you'll be fine?

58782|0x004AF484|...Yeah.
58783|0x004AF497|...Yeah.
58784|0x004AF4AF|We got off the train and went outside to the rotary.
58785|0x004AF4EE|We got off the train and went~outside to the rotary.
58786|0x004AF532|This was the beginning of the hill.
58787|0x004AF560|This was the beginning of the~hill.
58788|0x004AF593|Along that path is my house, then Hibari High, and then the lookout~even further beyond that.
58789|0x004AF5FB|Along that path is my house,~then Hibari High, and then the~lookout even further beyond~that.
58790|0x004AF668|Yume's eyes were set on that long slope.
58791|0x004AF69B|Yume's eyes were set on that~long slope.
58792|0x004AF6D3|She looked at it with the same gaze she looked out the window.
58793|0x004AF71C|She looked at it with the same~gaze she looked out the window.

58805|0x004AFACD|When my palm touched hers, Yume~squeezed my hand and smiled.

58832|0x004B01AC|Yume looked up at it.
58833|0x004B01CC|Yume looked up at it.
58834|0x004B01F1|She kept gazing at it for a long time, almost like she wanted to~engrave its image into her mind.

58840|0x004B03AE|One of them probably is, yeah.
58841|0x004B03D7|One of them probably is, yeah.
58842|0x004B041F|Well, we'd better not. You should be off at school around now, so they~wouldn't be very happy with you for skipping.
58843|0x004B049E|Well, we'd better not. You~should be off at school around~now, so they wouldn't be very~happy with you for skipping.

58861|0x004B08D2|It may be some day not too far~off, but there's also the~possibility it may be never...

58864|0x004B0A57|Yume then started walking again, so I could only follow along.
58865|0x004B0AA0|Yume then started walking~again, so I could only follow~along.
58866|0x004B0AEE|She was walking slowly, but still with a steady pace. I saw no signs~of her being tired yet.
58867|0x004B0B55|She was walking slowly, but~still with a steady pace. I saw~no signs of her being tired~yet.

58870|0x004B0CDE|Hibari High's school gate came into sight.
58871|0x004B0D13|Hibari High's school gate came~into sight.

58876|0x004B0EB9|I could sense that even when I was a kid.
58877|0x004B0EED|I could sense that even when I~was a kid.
58878|0x004B0F5A|I wonder if the others are all in the middle of classes right now...
58879|0x004B0FA9|I wonder if the others are all~in the middle of classes right~now...
58880|0x004B1007|Lunch break is over, so they probably are.
58881|0x004B103C|Lunch break is over, so they~probably are.
58882|0x004B1076|I couldn't see anyone around. It was dead silent.
58883|0x004B10B2|I couldn't see anyone around.~It was dead silent.
58884|0x004B110D|What do you think would happen if I yelled that there was a bad~student out here who's skipping school?
58885|0x004B117F|What do you think would happen~if I yelled that there was a~bad student out here who's~skipping school?
58886|0x004B1200|I'd make a run for it.

58888|0x004B1261|You'd leave me behind?

58892|0x004B1319|Pulling me by my hand?

58894|0x004B136A|Nope, more dramatic. I'd pick you up and carry you off in my arms.
58895|0x004B13B7|Nope, more dramatic. I'd pick~you up and carry you off in my~arms.
58896|0x004B1423|You must be the rascal prince type if you're gonna go kidnapping the~princess.
58897|0x004B147C|You must be the rascal prince~type if you're gonna go~kidnapping the princess.
58898|0x004B14DA|I had to wonder if anyone would see us if we hung around for too long.
58899|0x004B152B|I had to wonder if anyone would~see us if we hung around for~too long.
58900|0x004B158B|Just a little more, Yume. We're almost to the lookout.

58902|0x004B162C|Ah, right. We better get going.

58906|0x004B175C|...What?

58908|0x004B1791|I was thinking I could show you around Hibari High when we have the~chance.

58910|0x004B1842|I wanted her to nod.
58911|0x004B1861|I wanted her to nod.
58912|0x004B1893|However, Yume only smiled at me.
58913|0x004B18BE|However, Yume only smiled at~me.
58914|0x004B18EE|It was intentional, of course. She avoided making promises for the~future.
58915|0x004B1943|It was intentional, of course.~She avoided making promises for~the future.
58916|0x004B19C8|Past Hibari High, the slope got even steeper.

58918|0x004B1A3D|Yume's steps started to get heavier.
58919|0x004B1A6C|Yume's steps started to get~heavier.

58925|0x004B1C74|No, I'm fine... It's just a~little further.
58926|0x004B1CAF|Her breathing was heavy, which I could easily see since it was cold~enough to make her breath visible.
58927|0x004B1D20|Her breathing was heavy, which~I could easily see since it was~cold enough to make her breath~visible.

58932|0x004B1E56|Given the situation, that body heat only served to heighten my anxiety~rather than set my mind at ease.

59464|0x004BA9A3|My mind went back to that day seven years ago. That Tanabata where~Yume and I swore to meet again. Recalling that sensation managed to~soothe my heart a bit, but reality came back and struck me, causing my~heart to bleed again.

60103|0x004C47FF|Asuho took one of them in hand~and read it to herself.
60104|0x004C4892|...I want to become friends with him.
60105|0x004C48C2|...I want to become friends~with him.
60106|0x004C48F7|Those were the words written down there.
60107|0x004C492A|Those were the words written~down there.
60108|0x004C4962|Back in elementary school, she made this wish card during homeroom as~part of a Tanabata event they were having.
60109|0x004C49DD|Back in elementary school, she~made this wish card during~homeroom as part of a Tanabata~event they were having.
60110|0x004C4AB2|Friends, huh...
60111|0x004C4ACC|Friends, huh...
60112|0x004C4AEB|At the time, Asuho wanted to become friends with You.
60113|0x004C4B2B|At the time, Asuho wanted to~become friends with You.
60114|0x004C4B70|He was the kind of boy that kept to himself, never involving himself~with his classmates. He always had this sort of atmosphere around him~that told you he didn't want to be bothered.
60115|0x004C4C32|He was the kind of boy that~kept to himself, never~involving himself with his~classmates. He always had this
60116|0x004C4CAE|Asuho's mind was always occupied with that boy back then.
60117|0x004C4CF2|Asuho's mind was always~occupied with that boy back~then.
60118|0x004C4D3B|She'd always look at him from afar, but really, she wanted to talk~with him and play with him.
60119|0x004C4DA4|She'd always look at him from~afar, but really, she wanted to~talk with him and play with~him.
60120|0x004C4E12|That wish was engraved in the card she holds.
60121|0x004C4E4A|That wish was engraved in the~card she holds.
60122|0x004C4E87|However, it didn't specifically mention his name.
60123|0x004C4EC3|However, it didn't specifically~mention his name.
60124|0x004C4F04|The thought was so embarrassing to the young Asuho that she just~couldn't bring herself to mention him directly. Because of that, she~left it vague, so nobody reading it would be able to figure out who it~referred to.
60125|0x004C4FE8|The thought was so embarrassing~to the young Asuho that she~just couldn't bring herself to~mention him directly. Because
60126|0x004C5070|Why did she find it embarrassing?
60127|0x004C509C|Why did she find it~embarrassing?
60128|0x004C50CD|Well, she didn't want to be teased by the other classmates, for one.~She didn't want them to pester her, pursuing the reason why she was so~concerned about that boy, You.
60129|0x004C5182|Well, she didn't want to be~teased by the other classmates,~for one. She didn't want them~to pester her, pursuing the
60130|0x004C5207|The thought of that was so embarrassing that it made her chest hurt.
60131|0x004C5256|The thought of that was so~embarrassing that it made her~chest hurt.
60132|0x004C52AA|Back then Asuho didn't quite have a good grasp on what those feelings~were.
60133|0x004C5300|Back then Asuho didn't quite~have a good grasp on what those~feelings were.
60134|0x004C5375|I was only in elementary, after all...
60135|0x004C53A6|I was only in elementary, after~all...
60136|0x004C53DC|Being a child still unknown to the ways of love and romance, of course~she couldn't express those feelings well.
60137|0x004C5457|Being a child still unknown to~the ways of love and romance,~of course she couldn't express~those feelings well.
60138|0x004C54D7|So, she thought that she only wanted to become friends with him.
60139|0x004C5522|So, she thought that she only~wanted to become friends with~him.
60140|0x004C5572|A long time passed, and that wish had now come true at Hibari High...
60141|0x004C55C2|A long time passed, and that~wish had now come true at~Hibari High...
60142|0x004C5617|It hadn't come true in the way she wanted, though.
60143|0x004C5654|It hadn't come true in the way~she wanted, though.
60144|0x004C5696|It wasn't until Asuho matured that she realized what her childhood~feelings for him meant.
60145|0x004C56FB|It wasn't until Asuho matured~that she realized what her~childhood feelings for him~meant.
60146|0x004C5765|She did want to become friends with him, yes.
60147|0x004C579D|She did want to become friends~with him, yes.
60148|0x004C57DA|But she didn't want to stop at just that.
60149|0x004C580E|But she didn't want to stop at~just that.
60150|0x004C5847|Looking back on herself, she felt sure that even as a child she wanted~to be more than just friends.
60151|0x004C58B6|Looking back on herself, she~felt sure that even as a child~she wanted to be more than just~friends.
60152|0x004C592A|And that is exactly why these memories of her first love now weighed~on her so heavily.
60153|0x004C598C|And that is exactly why these~memories of her first love now~weighed on her so heavily.
60154|0x004C59F3|Being able to comprehend her childhood first love, at the same time,~she could also understand You's feelings.
60155|0x004C5A6C|Being able to comprehend her~childhood first love, at the~same time, she could also~understand You's feelings.
60156|0x004C5AEA|Wanting to hold onto those memories, to cherish them forever... In a~way, Asuho could relate her own feelings to You's feelings for the~girl from the lookout.
60157|0x004C5B93|Wanting to hold onto those~memories, to cherish them~forever... In a way, Asuho~could relate her own feelings
60158|0x004C5C10|The feelings that Asuho felt for You only grew larger and heavier from~the years that passed.
60159|0x004C5C78|The feelings that Asuho felt~for You only grew larger and~heavier from the years that~passed.
60160|0x004C5CE5|Those feelings became more painful for her heart.
60161|0x004C5D21|Those feelings became more~painful for her heart.
60162|0x004C5D62|Understanding that You felt just as deeply for the girl from the~lookout made Asuho's heart ache.
60163|0x004C5DCE|Understanding that You felt~just as deeply for the girl~from the lookout made Asuho's~heart ache.
60164|0x004C5E3F|There was nothing she could do with those feelings...
60165|0x004C5E7F|There was nothing she could do~with those feelings...
60166|0x004C5EDE|...Why am I telling myself that now? I already know that.
60167|0x004C5F22|...Why am I telling myself that~now? I already know that.
60168|0x004C5F6B|That is why Asuho's wish was only a meager one.
60169|0x004C5FA5|That is why Asuho's wish was~only a meager one.
60170|0x004C5FE4|Just having become friends with him was enough for her.
60171|0x004C6026|Just having become friends with~him was enough for her.
60172|0x004C606D|If she could just gaze up at the stars together with him, that was~enough to make her happy.
60173|0x004C60D4|If she could just gaze up at~the stars together with him,~that was enough to make her~happy.
60174|0x004C6140|They didn't need to become a couple.
60175|0x004C616F|They didn't need to become a~couple.
60176|0x004C61A3|After all, for You to accept her would mean throwing away all of his~memories of that girl.
60177|0x004C6209|After all, for You to accept~her would mean throwing away~all of his memories of that~girl.
60178|0x004C6274|For him, it would be the same as completely giving up on the girl from~the lookout.
60179|0x004C62D2|For him, it would be the same~as completely giving up on the~girl from the lookout.
60180|0x004C6335|And that would certainly make him sad.
60181|0x004C6366|And that would certainly make~him sad.
60182|0x004C639C|She could clearly see that by relating him to herself.
60183|0x004C63DD|She could clearly see that by~relating him to herself.
60184|0x004C6423|(He'd feel the same way that I do now...)
60185|0x004C6457|(He'd feel the same way that I~do now...)
60186|0x004C649C|......
60187|0x004C64AD|......
60188|0x004C650C|There were two wish cards inside the drawer.
60189|0x004C6543|There were two wish cards~inside the drawer.
60190|0x004C657F|One of them was written by Asuho when she was a young girl.
60191|0x004C65C5|One of them was written by~Asuho when she was a young~girl.
60192|0x004C6610|And the other one was written by You around the same time.
60193|0x004C6655|And the other one was written~by You around the same time.
60194|0x004C66F2|...It's time to go.

60196|0x004C6754|Asuho closed the drawer.

60202|0x004C6912|She put on a smile bright enough to rival even the sun.
60203|0x004C6954|She put on a smile bright~enough to rival even the sun.
60204|0x004C699B|If she were to act dejected, that would only spread and worsen the~moods of her classmates.
60205|0x004C6A01|If she were to act dejected,~that would only spread and~worsen the moods of her~classmates.
60206|0x004C6A6C|(I don't want to make You worry about me...)
60207|0x004C6AA3|(I don't want to make You worry~about me...)
60208|0x004C6ADF|As such, Asuho had to keep her expression bright.
60209|0x004C6B1B|As such, Asuho had to keep her~expression bright.
60210|0x004C6B5C|That was what Minahoshi Asuho resolved herself to do, ever after she~met You again in Hibarigasaki.

60305|0x004C835B|...Oh, right.

60313|0x004C85A6|Maybe you really haven't~changed that much since~elementary.
60314|0x004C860C|It feels like the only thing that's important to you is the lookout...
60315|0x004C865D|It feels like the only thing~that's important to you is the~lookout...
60316|0x004C86B3|I laughed lightly.

60318|0x004C86FC|Look, that's really not the case.
60319|0x004C8728|Look, that's really not the~case.
60320|0x004C8773|...I'm not so sure about that.

60322|0x004C87D4|I mean it.
60323|0x004C87E9|I mean it.
60324|0x004C8803|I could say so with confidence.
60325|0x004C882D|I could say so with confidence.
60326|0x004C8866|Back in grade school, I had no one I could call a friend, but now I~have plenty.
60327|0x004C88C1|Back in grade school, I had no~one I could call a friend, but~now I have plenty.

60330|0x004C89EE|That's all there was to it.

60575|0x004CE044|The problem is that the Student~Council is understaffed.
60576|0x004CE098|And to make matters worse, the third-year members won't be able to~commit much of their time since they'll be busy studying for~university entrance exams.

60590|0x004CE541|There's no point to it if the person in question isn't up to it. The~same goes for the Astro Club, right?

60622|0x004CEF29|Yeah. I actually like wasting my time, to be honest.
60623|0x004CEF68|Yeah. I actually like wasting~my time, to be honest.
60624|0x004CEFC6|What you're saying is just as rude to astronomy fans!
60625|0x004CF006|What you're saying is just as~rude to astronomy fans!
60626|0x004CF090|So the reason you've turned me down is the Astro Club.
60627|0x004CF0D1|So the reason you've turned me~down is the Astro Club.
60628|0x004CF121|Basically.
60629|0x004CF136|Basically.
60630|0x004CF16A|If you had joined the Student Council, you wouldn't have had time to~attend club. Considering that, I suppose you have made a wise choice.
60631|0x004CF1FF|If you had joined the Student~Council, you wouldn't have had~time to attend club.~Considering that, I suppose you
60632|0x004CF280|Since the Student Council was going to get really busy soon, I guess~that's why Hisakaki called herself a paper member.
60633|0x004CF302|Since the Student Council was~going to get really busy soon,~I guess that's why Hisakaki~called herself a paper member.
60634|0x004CF3CD|I always knew you were on our side, You-chan!

60643|0x004CF6A4|But I would mind.
60644|0x004CF701|Yeah, Asuho-kun has a bad sense of personal space. I also had a hard~time with it in the beginning.
60645|0x004CF76F|Yeah, Asuho-kun has a bad sense~of personal space. I also had a~hard time with it in the~beginning.
60646|0x004CF7EC|...What's that mean?
60647|0x004CF80B|...What's that mean?
60648|0x004CF849|Asuho-san normally puts herself at a much closer distance to people~when talking to them.
60649|0x004CF8AD|Asuho-san normally puts herself~at a much closer distance to~people when talking to them.
60650|0x004CF94A|In other words, her sense of distance is critically defective.
60651|0x004CF993|In other words, her sense of~distance is critically~defective.
60652|0x004CFA25|Don't make it sound like I'm disabled or something!
60653|0x004CFA63|Don't make it sound like I'm~disabled or something!
60654|0x004CFAC0|Like, walking into glass doors while walking through hallways, or~crashing into automatic sliding doors. That's the kind of stuff she'd~do.

60657|0x004CFC21|Don't make up stuff about me!!
60658|0x004CFC59|Like inattention to what's in front of her?
60659|0x004CFC8F|Like inattention to what's in~front of her?
60660|0x004CFCE4|Hmm, more like permanent inattention to everything.
60661|0x004CFD22|Hmm, more like permanent~inattention to everything.
60662|0x004CFD7F|That's totally not true!
60663|0x004CFDA2|That's totally not true!
60664|0x004CFE11|I believe distance has an emotional connection in her case.
60665|0x004CFE57|I believe distance has an~emotional connection in her~case.
60666|0x004CFEAE|Since Asuho is quick to develop friendship with others, naturally the~distance also gets close, no?
60667|0x004CFF1C|Since Asuho is quick to develop~friendship with others,~naturally the distance also~gets close, no?
60668|0x004CFFCB|Apart from that, there's also the fact that girls are generally more~about physical contact than guys.
60669|0x004D003C|Apart from that, there's also~the fact that girls are~generally more about physical~contact than guys.
60670|0x004D00CC|A certain institution did research pertaining to body language, and~apparently found that the amount of bodily contact during~conversations between women is on average six times higher than during~conversations between men.
60671|0x004D01B6|A certain institution did~research pertaining to body~language, and apparently found~that the amount of bodily
60672|0x004D0240|Come to think of it, I heard children that experience frequent bodily~contact with their mother grow up healthier.
60673|0x004D02BD|Come to think of it, I heard~children that experience~frequent bodily contact with~their mother grow up healthier.
60674|0x004D0359|It's not only beneficial health-wise, but it's also said that it's~easier to develop bonds with others through physical contact.
60675|0x004D03E4|It's not only beneficial~health-wise, but it's also said~that it's easier to develop~bonds with others through
60676|0x004D047C|It's the same with pet therapy. By petting the animal, the person~calms down, while the animal grows attached to the human.
60677|0x004D0502|It's the same with pet therapy.~By petting the animal, the~person calms down, while the~animal grows attached to the
60678|0x004D05A0|Now that I think back, I realize that whenever Asuho-san is talking to~Kogasaka-san, her distance to him is exceedingly close.
60679|0x004D0629|Now that I think back, I~realize that whenever Asuho-san~is talking to Kogasaka-san, her~distance to him is exceedingly
60680|0x004D06CA|I guess her sense of distance is even worse when it comes to~Kogasaka-kun.
60681|0x004D071F|I guess her sense of distance~is even worse when it comes to~Kogasaka-kun.
60682|0x004D07AC|In other words, Minahoshi-san's trying to pounce on Kogasaka-kun.
60683|0x004D07F8|In other words, Minahoshi-san's~trying to pounce on~Kogasaka-kun.
60684|0x004D08A8|Where has this conversation even gone?!
60685|0x004D08DA|Where has this conversation~even gone?!
60686|0x004D0911|Asuho shouted, her face bright red.
60687|0x004D093F|Asuho shouted, her face bright~red.
60688|0x004D0991|You're amazing, Asuho.
60689|0x004D09B2|You're amazing, Asuho.
60690|0x004D09F2|How am I supposed to take that?!
60691|0x004D0A1D|How am I supposed to take~that?!
60692|0x004D0A57|When it comes to closing the distance, there certainly are the effects~the others just mentioned, but it also makes it easier for you to get~hurt.
60693|0x004D0AF4|When it comes to closing the~distance, there certainly are~the effects the others just~mentioned, but it also makes it
60694|0x004D0B84|The fact that you can still get close to people nonetheless shows that~you have courage.

60696|0x004D0C59|I find that amazing.
60697|0x004D0C78|I find that amazing.
60698|0x004D0CB6|...Y-You really think so?
60699|0x004D0CDA|...Y-You really think so?
60700|0x004D0D0D|Absolutely.
60701|0x004D0D23|Absolutely.
60702|0x004D0D3E|That was something I couldn't hope to do. That went double for when I~was a kid.
60703|0x004D0D99|That was something I couldn't~hope to do. That went double~for when I was a kid.
60704|0x004D0E03|To begin with, there's nothing bad about being close to others.

60706|0x004D0EB6|But you ran away.

60709|0x004D0F1B|...I'll try not to.
60710|0x004D0F63|Okay then.
60711|0x004D0F78|Okay then.
60712|0x004D0F92|Asuho's expression changed to a satisfied one.
60713|0x004D0FCB|Asuho's expression changed to a~satisfied one.
60714|0x004D103E|That was the perfect response for that situation, Kogasaka-san.
60715|0x004D1088|That was the perfect response~for that situation,~Kogasaka-san.
60716|0x004D110E|For now, I think I'd like you to be careful not to just draw close to~whoever.
60717|0x004D1167|For now, I think I'd like you~to be careful not to just draw~close to whoever.
60718|0x004D11ED|Well, I am careful when I'm serving customers.
60719|0x004D1226|Well, I am careful when I'm~serving customers.
60720|0x004D1264|I reckon people would feel quite awkward if they suddenly found a maid~a couple of inches away from their face.
60721|0x004D12DE|I reckon people would feel~quite awkward if they suddenly~found a maid a couple of inches~away from their face.
60722|0x004D13AE|Just great, now I've wasted more time than I anticipated because of~this nonsense. And I haven't even eaten lunch yet.

60742|0x004D1B5D|After talking things through, we settled on reserving our stargazing~sessions for Saturday nights.

61026|0x004D67D2|Why?
61027|0x004D67E1|Why?
61028|0x004D67FF|You always approach others proactively. You're a courageous girl, and~I guess that's what allows you to do that. Didn't I already say this~back in the club room?

61064|0x004D719E|Yep.
61065|0x004D71AD|Yep.
61066|0x004D71C1|Exhaustion hit me.
61067|0x004D71DE|Exhaustion hit me.
61068|0x004D722F|So you don't need the money?
61069|0x004D7256|So you don't need the money?
61070|0x004D728C|Of course not.
61071|0x004D72A5|Of course not.
61072|0x004D72DD|Do you wanna go stargazing with me?
61073|0x004D730B|Do you wanna go stargazing with~me?
61074|0x004D7348|Sure. That's something I wanted to do anyway.
61075|0x004D7380|Sure. That's something I wanted~to do anyway.
61076|0x004D73D7|Because you want to go look for the girl from the lookout?
61077|0x004D741C|Because you want to go look for~the girl from the lookout?
61078|0x004D7470|No.
61079|0x004D747E|No.
61080|0x004D74C0|Because you want to see Mare-chan?
61081|0x004D74ED|Because you want to see~Mare-chan?
61082|0x004D7529|Because I want to see the stars together with you.
61083|0x004D7566|Because I want to see the stars~together with you.
61084|0x004D75C2|You're such a nice guy.
61085|0x004D75E4|You're such a nice guy.
61086|0x004D7615|Yeah... you're acting strange today.
61087|0x004D7644|Yeah... you're acting strange~today.
61088|0x004D76A7|I'm totally not.
61089|0x004D76C2|I'm totally not.
61090|0x004D76EC|Yes, you are, I promise you.
61091|0x004D7713|Yes, you are, I promise you.
61092|0x004D7759|Ahaha. Let's just say I am then.
61093|0x004D7784|Ahaha. Let's just say I am~then.
61094|0x004D77B4|I felt like she was kind of dodging the issue.
61095|0x004D77ED|I felt like she was kind of~dodging the issue.
61096|0x004D782B|The proactive Asuho, and the reserved Asuho. Which one is the real~Asuho?
61097|0x004D787F|The proactive Asuho, and the~reserved Asuho. Which one is~the real Asuho?
61098|0x004D78D8|Or is it that both of them are different sides of the same Asuho's~heart?
61099|0x004D792C|Or is it that both of them are~different sides of the same~Asuho's heart?
61100|0x004D7A3A|We made it to the lookout safe and sound!
61101|0x004D7A6E|We made it to the lookout safe~and sound!
61102|0x004D7AB1|I wonder how many times that makes now.
61103|0x004D7AE3|I wonder how many times that~makes now.
61104|0x004D7B34|I don't know, but besides that, this is our first time seeing the fall~sky together.
61105|0x004D7B93|I don't know, but besides that,~this is our first time seeing~the fall sky together.
61106|0x004D7BF7|Since Hibarigasaki is located in the north, the temperature falls once~September comes around, so we are already wearing our autumn clothing.
61107|0x004D7C8F|Since Hibarigasaki is located~in the north, the temperature~falls once September comes~around, so we are already
61108|0x004D7D0F|I don't know whether it is because the air is cool or what, but the~night sky is full of clear starlight.
61109|0x004D7D83|I don't know whether it is~because the air is cool or~what, but the night sky is full~of clear starlight.
61110|0x004D7E33|Great, my rain alarm is silent, too. We'll have perfect weather for~stargazing!
61111|0x004D7E8D|Great, my rain alarm is silent,~too. We'll have perfect weather~for stargazing!
61112|0x004D7F08|Asuho started to jauntily assemble the telescope.
61113|0x004D7F44|Asuho started to jauntily~assemble the telescope.
61114|0x004D7F85|Usually I'd go look for Mare now, but...
61115|0x004D7FB8|Usually I'd go look for Mare~now, but...
61116|0x004D7FFA|Let me help too.
61117|0x004D8015|Let me help too.
61118|0x004D8035|I crouched down next to Asuho.
61119|0x004D805E|I crouched down next to Asuho.
61120|0x004D80BF|...Are you sure?
61121|0x004D80DA|...Are you sure?
61122|0x004D8104|Don't hold back. That's not like you.
61123|0x004D8134|Don't hold back. That's not~like you.
61124|0x004D8183|But, aren't you...
61125|0x004D81A0|But, aren't you...
61126|0x004D81CC|If Mare wants to stargaze with us, I'm sure she'll come out on her~own.
61127|0x004D821E|If Mare wants to stargaze with~us, I'm sure she'll come out on~her own.
61128|0x004D8275|Even if she didn't show herself, she would no doubt be watching us~from some tree branch.
61129|0x004D82D9|Even if she didn't show~herself, she would no doubt be~watching us from some tree~branch.
61130|0x004D8342|To Mare, that would probably count as stargazing with us.
61131|0x004D8386|To Mare, that would probably~count as stargazing with us.
61132|0x004D83E9|Okay, then I'll take care of the stand, so could you handle the~equatorial mount?
61133|0x004D8445|Okay, then I'll take care of~the stand, so could you handle~the equatorial mount?
61134|0x004D84B0|Sure thing.
61135|0x004D84C6|Sure thing.
61136|0x004D8500|I fixed the equatorial mount on the tripod Asuho had set up.
61137|0x004D8547|I fixed the equatorial mount on~the tripod Asuho had set up.
61138|0x004D8593|Following that, we set in place the telescope's tube, attached the~finder and lens, and plugged in the remote control for the auto-search~function.
61139|0x004D8631|Following that, we set in place~the telescope's tube, attached~the finder and lens, and~plugged in the remote control
61140|0x004D86B6|Then we just had to wait thirty minutes.
61141|0x004D86E9|Then we just had to wait thirty~minutes.
61142|0x004D8775|That was the first time we set it up together, you know.
61143|0x004D87B8|That was the first time we set~it up together, you know.
61144|0x004D880A|Didn't we set it up along with the rest of the Astro Club?
61145|0x004D884F|Didn't we set it up along with~the rest of the Astro Club?
61146|0x004D88C8|But never when it was just us.
61147|0x004D88F1|But never when it was just us.
61148|0x004D891F|Unlike on the school rooftop, I was always off looking for Mare when~we were at the lookout.
61149|0x004D8986|Unlike on the school rooftop, I~was always off looking for Mare~when we were at the lookout.
61150|0x004D89F2|Maybe that had also meant searching for the girl from the lookout.
61151|0x004D8A3F|Maybe that had also meant~searching for the girl from the~lookout.
61152|0x004D8A9B|I've always wanted to ask you this.
61153|0x004D8AC9|I've always wanted to ask you~this.
61154|0x004D8AFC|The lookout was veiled in tranquility.
61155|0x004D8B2D|The lookout was veiled in~tranquility.
61156|0x004D8B63|She and I casually talked while sitting on the grass.
61157|0x004D8BA3|She and I casually talked while~sitting on the grass.
61158|0x004D8BF2|Why do you love the stars?
61159|0x004D8C17|Why do you love the stars?
61160|0x004D8C41|I sat and looked up at the sky as I chatted with a girl who loves the~stars.
61161|0x004D8C98|I sat and looked up at the sky~as I chatted with a girl who~loves the stars.
61162|0x004D8D23|In your case, it's because of the girl from the lookout, right?
61163|0x004D8D6D|In your case, it's because of~the girl from the lookout,~right?
61164|0x004D8DC6|Yeah.
61165|0x004D8DD6|Yeah.
61166|0x004D8E05|In my case, it's because of my dad.
61167|0x004D8E33|In my case, it's because of my~dad.
61168|0x004D8E66|Slowly, Asuho began to tell her story.
61169|0x004D8E97|Slowly, Asuho began to tell her~story.
61170|0x004D8EE7|Back when I was a kid, my dad would always tell me about the myths~surrounding the different constellations... and I bet he'd been doing~it since before I can remember, too.
61171|0x004D8F9F|Back when I was a kid, my dad~would always tell me about the~myths surrounding the different~constellations... and I bet
61172|0x004D9033|Maybe that was his form of a lullaby. Like he meant to calm me down~with those.
61173|0x004D908D|Maybe that was his form of a~lullaby. Like he meant to calm~me down with those.
61174|0x004D9106|But that doesn't matter. I simply loved the constellation myths my dad~would always tell me.
61175|0x004D916D|But that doesn't matter. I~simply loved the constellation~myths my dad would always tell~me.
61176|0x004D91F3|That's what got me to love stargazing in the first place.
61177|0x004D9237|That's what got me to love~stargazing in the first place.
61178|0x004D929A|Which led to me loving the stars.
61179|0x004D92C6|Which led to me loving the~stars.
61180|0x004D92F7|Asuho wrapped up her story with that.
61181|0x004D9327|Asuho wrapped up her story with~that.
61182|0x004D9366|Your dad was the president of Hibari High's Astronomy Club, right?
61183|0x004D93B3|Your dad was the president of~Hibari High's Astronomy Club,~right?
61184|0x004D9434|He was a lot more than just that.
61185|0x004D9460|He was a lot more than just~that.
61186|0x004D94AB|My dad was an actual astronomer, if you can believe it.
61187|0x004D94ED|My dad was an actual~astronomer, if you can believe~it.
61188|0x004D9534|From Astronomy Club member to professional astronomer.
61189|0x004D9575|From Astronomy Club member to~professional astronomer.
61190|0x004D95BB|I guess you could say that was a dream come true for him.
61191|0x004D95FF|I guess you could say that was~a dream come true for him.
61192|0x004D9677|But he eventually quit...
61193|0x004D969B|But he eventually quit...
61194|0x004D96DE|He quit his job as an astronomer and started up a cafe.
61195|0x004D9720|He quit his job as an~astronomer and started up a~cafe.
61196|0x004D9781|I think it was only shortly after you moved away...
61197|0x004D97BF|I think it was only shortly~after you moved away...
61198|0x004D9802|That would explain why I didn't recognize the place when we first went~there after coming back to Hibarigasaki.
61199|0x004D987C|That would explain why I didn't~recognize the place when we~first went there after coming~back to Hibarigasaki.
61200|0x004D9905|Why exactly did he quit?
61201|0x004D9928|Why exactly did he quit?
61202|0x004D996A|Beats me.
61203|0x004D997E|Beats me.
61204|0x004D99B1|He doesn't tell me anything...
61205|0x004D99DA|He doesn't tell me anything...
61206|0x004D9A26|After that, the two of us silently gazed up at the starlit night sky~for a while.
61207|0x004D9A82|After that, the two of us~silently gazed up at the~starlit night sky for a while.
61208|0x004D9AE3|Unlike back in August, though, we couldn't see any shooting stars.
61209|0x004D9B30|Unlike back in August, though,~we couldn't see any shooting~stars.
61210|0x004D9BD6|Today, regular classes would start back up.
61211|0x004D9C0C|Today, regular classes would~start back up.
61212|0x004D9C4C|We attended all the same classes, just like the first semester, but~then our teacher informed us during afternoon homeroom that the Hibari~Festival was coming up.
61213|0x004D9CF9|We attended all the same~classes, just like the first~semester, but then our teacher~informed us during afternoon
61214|0x004D9D7A|The festival will be held over the course of two days, the 7th and 8th~of October. All we are really told is the date, which I'm guessing is~because it is still a month away.
61215|0x004D9E33|The festival will be held over~the course of two days, the 7th~and 8th of October. All we are~really told is the date, which
61216|0x004D9F1A|Hearing about the festival really gets you in that fall mood.
61217|0x004D9F62|Hearing about the festival~really gets you in that fall~mood.
61218|0x004D9FB9|I'm kinda surprised the school festival isn't held on Culture Day.
61219|0x004DA006|I'm kinda surprised the school~festival isn't held on Culture~Day.
61220|0x004DA058|The 8th of October happens to be Health and Sports Day.
61221|0x004DA09A|The 8th of October happens to~be Health and Sports Day.
61222|0x004DA0FB|Culture Day is in November, so I guess they hold it ahead of time so~they can have it when it's warmer out and stuff.
61223|0x004DA17B|Culture Day is in November, so~I guess they hold it ahead of~time so they can have it when~it's warmer out and stuff.
61224|0x004DA238|True. We have to remember that Hibarigasaki is a northern town, after~all.
61225|0x004DA28D|True. We have to remember that~Hibarigasaki is a northern~town, after all.
61226|0x004DA2E7|Makes sense.
61227|0x004DA2FE|Makes sense.
61228|0x004DA334|Ahh, I'm already so pumped for Hibari Festival, you don't even know!
61229|0x004DA383|Ahh, I'm already so pumped for~Hibari Festival, you don't even~know!
61230|0x004DA3EF|I remember you being the exact same way around the summer festival.
61231|0x004DA43D|I remember you being the exact~same way around the summer~festival.
61232|0x004DA490|I don't know if there will be booths like the shooting range and~goldfish scooping, but I'm sure Asuho will enjoy herself to the~fullest.
61233|0x004DA524|I don't know if there will be~booths like the shooting range~and goldfish scooping, but I'm~sure Asuho will enjoy herself
61234|0x004DA5D4|Do students prepare programs and stuff?
61235|0x004DA606|Do students prepare programs~and stuff?
61236|0x004DA657|Of course. It wouldn't be a school festival without that.
61237|0x004DA69B|Of course. It wouldn't be a~school festival without that.
61238|0x004DA6EE|But the preparations haven't started yet, yeah?
61239|0x004DA728|But the preparations haven't~started yet, yeah?
61240|0x004DA781|Nope. About two weeks before is usually when everyone starts getting~ready.
61241|0x004DA7D7|Nope. About two weeks before is~usually when everyone starts~getting ready.
61242|0x004DA869|Although the students in the Student Council, like Nee-san, will start~doing things rather early on as part of the Festival Committee.
61243|0x004DA8FA|Although the students in the~Student Council, like Nee-san,~will start doing things rather~early on as part of the
61244|0x004DA986|Yeah, I remember her saying they'd have their hands full.
61245|0x004DA9CA|Yeah, I remember her saying~they'd have their hands full.
61246|0x004DAA52|You're a class rep, Minahoshi, so shouldn't you have more stuff to do~than us normal students?
61247|0x004DAABB|You're a class rep, Minahoshi,~so shouldn't you have more~stuff to do than us normal~students?
61248|0x004DAB43|Not really. My job is pretty much just relaying things from the~Student Council to our class.
61249|0x004DABAB|Not really. My job is pretty~much just relaying things from~the Student Council to our~class.
61250|0x004DAC3F|Oh, were you class rep last year, too?
61251|0x004DAC70|Oh, were you class rep last~year, too?
61252|0x004DACC0|Well, ever since grade school if we're being honest.
61253|0x004DACFF|Well, ever since grade school~if we're being honest.
61254|0x004DAD4D|...You do it every year?
61255|0x004DAD70|...You do it every year?
61256|0x004DADB2|It's not like I'm volunteering though.
61257|0x004DADE3|It's not like I'm volunteering~though.
61258|0x004DAE50|She always gets chosen by nomination.
61259|0x004DAE80|She always gets chosen by~nomination.
61260|0x004DAEB5|I guess that speaks to Asuho's character.
61261|0x004DAEE9|I guess that speaks to Asuho's~character.
61262|0x004DAF2C|What kinda stuff goes on at Hibari Festival, by the way?
61263|0x004DAF6F|What kinda stuff goes on at~Hibari Festival, by the way?
61264|0x004DAFD1|Hmm, I think it's pretty much like any other school festival. Classes~set up booths, clubs do their own thing, too. You know...
61265|0x004DB05B|Hmm, I think it's pretty much~like any other school festival.~Classes set up booths, clubs do~their own thing, too. You
61266|0x004DB0FC|The majority of clubs go with some sort of program rather than booths.~It's typical for the Drama Club to do a play, and the Movie Club to~screen a movie, for instance.
61267|0x004DB1AF|The majority of clubs go with~some sort of program rather~than booths. It's typical for~the Drama Club to do a play,
61268|0x004DB267|There's also a Hibari High Grand Prix. They pick the club or class~that put on the best event.
61269|0x004DB2D0|There's also a Hibari High~Grand Prix. They pick the club~or class that put on the best~event.
61270|0x004DB358|On the night of the second day, to conclude the entire event, they~have a huge bonfire.
61271|0x004DB3BA|On the night of the second day,~to conclude the entire event,~they have a huge bonfire.
61272|0x004DB43B|Something like an after party.
61273|0x004DB464|Something like an after party.
61274|0x004DB4AC|There's a folk dance there. too! Participation isn't mandatory or~anything, though, so apparently not many people get out and dance.
61275|0x004DB53B|There's a folk dance there.~too! Participation isn't~mandatory or anything, though,~so apparently not many people
61276|0x004DB5D6|Well, no duh. Folk dance is done in opposite sex pairs.
61277|0x004DB618|Well, no duh. Folk dance is~done in opposite sex pairs.
61278|0x004DB679|Very true. Dancing together there is pretty much akin to openly~declaring that you're a couple.
61279|0x004DB6E3|Very true. Dancing together~there is pretty much akin to~openly declaring that you're a~couple.
61280|0x004DB76C|Yeah, we didn't participate last year either.
61281|0x004DB7A4|Yeah, we didn't participate~last year either.
61282|0x004DB7E1|According to what they'd told me, it didn't seem all that different~from the school festivals I experienced back in the city.
61283|0x004DB869|According to what they'd told~me, it didn't seem all that~different from the school~festivals I experienced back in
61284|0x004DB8EC|Except for the after party at the end, that is.
61285|0x004DB926|Except for the after party at~the end, that is.
61286|0x004DB96F|That huge bonfire kinda sounds neat. I'm a bit interested to see it.
61287|0x004DB9BE|That huge bonfire kinda sounds~neat. I'm a bit interested to~see it.
61288|0x004DBA3A|They didn't have one at your previous school?
61289|0x004DBA72|They didn't have one at your~previous school?
61290|0x004DBAB9|Nope. It did come up, but permission never came through. Our sports~field was too small or something.
61291|0x004DBB29|Nope. It did come up, but~permission never came through.~Our sports field was too small~or something.
61292|0x004DBBB8|Well, I reckon it's dangerous to do that in a small area.
61293|0x004DBBFC|Well, I reckon it's dangerous~to do that in a small area.
61294|0x004DBC5F|Then since this will be your first time, why don't you participate in~the dance?
61295|0x004DBCBA|Then since this will be your~first time, why don't you~participate in the dance?
61296|0x004DBD24|...Well, if there's a girl for me to dance with, then sure, I guess.

61801|0x004E64CE|Yeah. I think it started back~around when I joined the Astro~Club. Komomo-chan suddenly~barged into the club room and

63201|0x00501E4A|When I filled in the last piece~of Asuho's puzzle, I found that~it also completed the puzzle~inside my own heart.

63947|0x0050D5D3|That's why my wife also left~me. I made Asuho suffer through~loneliness.
63948|0x0050D645|Seized by regret, I retired from that profession and opened myself up~a cafe. Though it honestly wouldn't have had to be a cafe.
