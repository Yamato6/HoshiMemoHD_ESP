95830|0x0075EC5C|...I didn't know that.
95831|0x0075EC7D|...I didn't know that.

97068|0x007735F8|The last bit went out due to her sobbing.
97069|0x0077362C|The last bit went out due to~her sobbing.
97070|0x00773665|In that moment I realized just how thoughtless I'd been.

97120|0x007742EA|Because he won't stay by my side...
97121|0x00774318|Because he won't stay by my~side...

99574|0x007A448C|I plan on asking a store to fix it directly. I know there's a music~box store here in Hibarigasaki.

99598|0x007A4DEF|While it's certainly broken, the kaleidoscope itself at least isn't.~Wanna take a look?
99599|0x007A4E51|While it's certainly broken,~the kaleidoscope itself at~least isn't. Wanna take a look?
99600|0x007A4EB8|By looking at the beads set into the rotating disc through the tube's~lens, I could see that this music box also functioned as a~kaleidoscope.

99650|0x007A5E52|I suppose she's at the age where she wants to act older than she~really is. I don't know how old she is, but she says unnaturally~philosophical things every now and then.

99740|0x007A79A9|Mare still had a peeved look on her face.
99741|0x007A79DD|Mare still had a peeved look on~her face.
99742|0x007A7A20|So, you see, I came here today because I wanted to make things up to~you.

99750|0x007A7C65|...What is this?

99752|0x007A7CAA|A music box.
99753|0x007A7CC1|A music box.
99754|0x007A7CE7|A mussy ox?
99755|0x007A7CFD|A mussy ox?
99756|0x007A7D22|...No, it's clearly not an ox. It's called a kaleidoscope music box.~So in short, it's a kaleidoscope.
99757|0x007A7D93|...No, it's clearly not an ox.~It's called a kaleidoscope~music box. So in short, it's a~kaleidoscope.
99758|0x007A7E09|Since the music box part was broken, that was perfectly correct.

99763|0x007A7F78|Yeah, remember? I promised that~I'd show you one.
99764|0x007A7FD1|It's as pretty as the starry sky, right?

99766|0x007A8046|Sure is. Wanna take a look?

99768|0x007A80AF|...Not like I care.
99769|0x007A80CD|...Not like I care.
99770|0x007A810B|But despite saying so, she readily came near me.
99771|0x007A8146|But despite saying so, she~readily came near me.
99772|0x007A81B5|I'll wind it up now.
99773|0x007A81D4|I'll wind it up now.
99774|0x007A8210|...Something's rotating.
99775|0x007A8233|...Something's rotating.
99776|0x007A8265|Okay, now what you'll want to do is look into the long tube above this~part that looks like a rotating gem.
99777|0x007A82DB|Okay, now what you'll want to~do is look into the long tube~above this part that looks like~a rotating gem.
99778|0x007A8356|I let Mare hold it.
99779|0x007A8374|I let Mare hold it.
99780|0x007A83AF|...So I only have to look inside?
99781|0x007A83DB|...So I only have to look~inside?
99782|0x007A8416|Yeah. Just like if you were looking through a telescope.
99783|0x007A8459|Yeah. Just like if you were~looking through a telescope.
99784|0x007A84A7|Mare tentatively drew her face near it.
99785|0x007A84D9|Mare tentatively drew her face~near it.
99786|0x007A8510|She closed one of her eyes, and used the other to peer inside.
99787|0x007A8559|She closed one of her eyes, and~used the other to peer inside.
99788|0x007A85D4|There's... all these patterns...
99789|0x007A85FF|There's... all these~patterns...
99790|0x007A8639|Red... blue... green... all sorts...

99793|0x007A86CA|There's so many colors...
99794|0x007A86FD|All sorts of shapes...
99795|0x007A871E|All sorts of shapes...
99796|0x007A874E|They're moving...
99797|0x007A876A|They're moving...
99798|0x007A8795|They keep changing...
99799|0x007A87B5|They keep changing...
99800|0x007A87E4|There are way more... than in the starry sky...
99801|0x007A881E|There are way more... than in~the starry sky...
99802|0x007A8867|More colors... more shapes... and it all moves faster...
99803|0x007A88AA|More colors... more shapes...~and it all moves faster...
99804|0x007A8935|After that, Mare fell silent.
99805|0x007A895D|After that, Mare fell silent.
99806|0x007A898A|She wholeheartedly gazed inside, observing the sky of gems that came~to life before her eyes.
99807|0x007A89F2|She wholeheartedly gazed~inside, observing the sky of~gems that came to life before~her eyes.
99808|0x007A8A5F|I decided to sit down on the spot.

99810|0x007A8ABE|And then I laid down.
99811|0x007A8ADE|And then I laid down.
99812|0x007A8B21|Many lights, not inferior to those of the kaleidoscope, were out~twinkling tonight.
99813|0x007A8B7F|Many lights, not inferior to~those of the kaleidoscope, were~out twinkling tonight.
99814|0x007A8BE2|The starry sky in summer hung over our heads.
99815|0x007A8C1A|The starry sky in summer hung~over our heads.
99816|0x007A8C57|When the season changes, the stars in the sky also change.
99817|0x007A8C9C|When the season changes, the~stars in the sky also change.
99818|0x007A8CE6|It's a change that occurs over a much longer period of time than the~change of the patterns in a kaleidoscope.
99819|0x007A8D5F|It's a change that occurs over~a much longer period of time~than the change of the patterns~in a kaleidoscope.
99820|0x007A8DDD|I decided to wait like this until Mare was done with the kaleidoscope.
99821|0x007A8E2E|I decided to wait like this~until Mare was done with the~kaleidoscope.

99832|0x007A9026|So, what did you think? Enjoy your first time looking through a~kaleidoscope?
99833|0x007A907E|So, what did you think? Enjoy~your first time looking through~a kaleidoscope?
99834|0x007A90F3|Well, it's not bad, but...
99835|0x007A9118|Well, it's not bad, but...
99836|0x007A9142|Mare appeared huffy.
99837|0x007A9161|Mare appeared huffy.
99838|0x007A9185|That was nothing unusual, and it was also the case when she used a~telescope for the first time, so that reaction didn't disappoint me.

99846|0x007A9432|The picture disappeared.

99848|0x007A9487|Oh, I guess the key stopped.
99849|0x007A94AE|Oh, I guess the key stopped.
99850|0x007A94F2|...Key?
99851|0x007A9504|...Key?

99865|0x007A986D|She was holding it behind her~back almost like she didn't~want me to see it.
99866|0x007A98D3|It stopped showing anything, right? Then we just gotta wind up the key~and it'll come back for you to see.

99876|0x007A9B30|Okay.
99877|0x007A9B40|Okay.

99897|0x007A9FA2|Wind it up and get it back to~how it was before.
99898|0x007A9FEC|That won't do anything! The thing's completely broken!
99899|0x007AA02D|That won't do anything! The~thing's completely broken!
99900|0x007AA08B|So hurry up and fix it.

99903|0x007AA119|I didn't know it was like this~when I said that!
99904|0x007AA171|...Liar.

99906|0x007AA19C|A terrible headache assaulted me.
99907|0x007AA1C8|A terrible headache assaulted~me.
99908|0x007AA203|Tell me... Just how in the world did it end up like this?
99909|0x007AA247|Tell me... Just how in the~world did it end up like this?
99910|0x007AA2A8|The patterns stopped showing, so I started shaking it and it ended up~like this.
99911|0x007AA303|The patterns stopped showing,~so I started shaking it and it~ended up like this.
99912|0x007AA363|The intensity of my headache increased.
99913|0x007AA395|The intensity of my headache~increased.
99914|0x007AA3CC|Considering it had stopped playing, maybe its age had made the whole~thing itself fragile.
99915|0x007AA431|Considering it had stopped~playing, maybe its age had made~the whole thing itself fragile.
99916|0x007AA4B3|...You said it'd return to normal by winding up the key.

99918|0x007AA548|Well yeah, but not if the thing's broken into parts like this...
99919|0x007AA593|Well yeah, but not if the~thing's broken into parts like~this...
99920|0x007AA5FB|There's a key at the bottom, right?
99921|0x007AA629|There's a key at the bottom,~right?
99922|0x007AA65C|She snatched the base out of my hands.

99924|0x007AA6DB|This thing here?

99930|0x007AA7AE|That's, uh...
99931|0x007AA7C6|That's, uh...
99932|0x007AA7E3|...I couldn't quite tell. It kind of looked like a chain.
99933|0x007AA827|...I couldn't quite tell. It~kind of looked like a chain.
99934|0x007AA888|It seems like something's stuck there.
99935|0x007AA8B9|It seems like something's stuck~there.
99936|0x007AA8FA|Mare began to forcefully pull at the chain.
99937|0x007AA930|Mare began to forcefully pull~at the chain.
99938|0x007AA975|Hey! Be more gentle with it. What if you break it even more?
99939|0x007AA9BC|Hey! Be more gentle with it.~What if you break it even more?
99940|0x007AAA08|(Oh geez, how am I going to explain this to Okaizumi-senpai?)

99944|0x007AAB05|I literally just told you not to break it even more!
99945|0x007AAB44|I literally just told you not~to break it even more!
99946|0x007AAB88|I took back the base.

99948|0x007AABCD|Mare had a pendant in her hand.
99949|0x007AABF7|Mare had a pendant in her hand.
99950|0x007AAC44|What's that?

99952|0x007AAC8F|It came out when I pulled on that chain thing.
99953|0x007AACC8|It came out when I pulled on~that chain thing.
99954|0x007AAD29|There was a plated gem ornament dangling from the chain.
99955|0x007AAD6C|There was a plated gem ornament~dangling from the chain.
99956|0x007AADB4|It looked rough, but I guess maybe the surface had been coated or~something, because it was reflecting the starlight faintly.
99957|0x007AAE3C|It looked rough, but I guess~maybe the surface had been~coated or something, because it~was reflecting the starlight
99958|0x007AAEC0|It was about the size of Mare's palm.
99959|0x007AAEF0|It was about the size of Mare's~palm.
99960|0x007AAF2F|What's this?
99961|0x007AAF46|What's this?
99962|0x007AAF6C|Well, I think it's a pendant... You said it came out from inside?
99963|0x007AAFB8|Well, I think it's a pendant...~You said it came out from~inside?
99964|0x007AB013|Uh-huh. Together with a spring.
99965|0x007AB03D|Uh-huh. Together with a spring.
99966|0x007AB0BD|...I'm begging you, please don't damage it more.
99967|0x007AB0F8|...I'm begging you, please~don't damage it more.
99968|0x007AB150|Where's the key?
99969|0x007AB16B|Where's the key?
99970|0x007AB195|...Look, winding it up won't do anything.
99971|0x007AB1C9|...Look, winding it up won't do~anything.
99972|0x007AB202|Rather, it'd only get more damaged if she kept fiddling with it.
99973|0x007AB24D|Rather, it'd only get more~damaged if she kept fiddling~with it.
99974|0x007AB2A7|I'll hold onto that.
99975|0x007AB2C6|I'll hold onto that.
99976|0x007AB2F0|I took the pendant from Mare.
99977|0x007AB318|I took the pendant from Mare.
99978|0x007AB35D|What are you gonna do with it?
99979|0x007AB386|What are you gonna do with it?
99980|0x007AB3BE|It might be a part of the music box, so yeah, naturally the only~choice I have is to have it fixed together with all the other parts.
99981|0x007AB44E|It might be a part of the music~box, so yeah, naturally the~only choice I have is to have~it fixed together with all the

99984|0x007AB525|I dunno. I'll have to ask.
99985|0x007AB54A|I dunno. I'll have to ask.
99986|0x007AB58C|......

100217|0x007B02C9|...I'm really sorry.
100218|0x007B0307|It's not your fault. It was already broken to begin with.
100219|0x007B034B|It's not your fault. It was~already broken to begin with.
100220|0x007B03AE|...It was?
100221|0x007B03C3|...It was?
100222|0x007B03F7|That's right. When the Astro Club got it, it was already broken and~wouldn't play.

100226|0x007B04E9|He was pondering something.
100227|0x007B050F|He was pondering something.
100228|0x007B0554|...The old Astronomy Club adviser is still teaching at Hibari High,~right? Have you told him?

100230|0x007B0633|Apparently Okaizumi-senpai asked him to get it repaired, but he was~told that there's no fixing it.

100232|0x007B0714|He furrowed his brow.
100233|0x007B0734|He furrowed his brow.
100234|0x007B0765|Well, that's odd.
100235|0x007B0781|Well, that's odd.
100236|0x007B07BC|Why?
100237|0x007B07CB|Why?
100238|0x007B07F9|Well...
100239|0x007B080B|Well...
100240|0x007B0822|Then he dodged the question.
100241|0x007B0849|Then he dodged the question.
100242|0x007B08AC|You-chan, what are you gonna do now? Still go to the music box store?
100243|0x007B08FC|You-chan, what are you gonna do~now? Still go to the music box~store?
100244|0x007B095B|Yeah, I'll talk it over with Okaizumi-senpai once he's back to normal.
100245|0x007B09AC|Yeah, I'll talk it over with~Okaizumi-senpai once he's back~to normal.
100246|0x007B0A1C|Here, I'll give this back to you.
100247|0x007B0A48|Here, I'll give this back to~you.
100248|0x007B0A96|She handed me the pendant. The boss caught sight of it.

100250|0x007B0B75|...What's that?
100251|0x007B0B8F|...What's that?
100252|0x007B0BB8|It was inside the music box. We thought it might be an interior~adornment.
100253|0x007B0C0D|It was inside the music box. We~thought it might be an interior~adornment.
100254|0x007B0C81|I doubt it. No use in putting an adornment where nobody can see.

100256|0x007B0D50|Can you open the box?
100257|0x007B0D70|Can you open the box?
100258|0x007B0DAF|I never heard anything about it opening up.
100259|0x007B0DE5|I never heard anything about it~opening up.
100260|0x007B0E20|(Then what is this pendant?)
100261|0x007B0E47|(Then what is this pendant?)
100262|0x007B0E8D|Mind if I take a quick look at it?
100263|0x007B0EBA|Mind if I take a quick look at~it?
100264|0x007B0EEC|I handed it to him.
100265|0x007B0F0A|I handed it to him.
100266|0x007B0F2D|He went on to inspect it by tapping, stroking it and such.
100267|0x007B0F72|He went on to inspect it by~tapping, stroking it and such.
100268|0x007B0FD6|...Meteorite, I'd say.

100270|0x007B1027|Is that the name of the gem or something?
100271|0x007B105B|Is that the name of the gem or~something?
100272|0x007B10AE|I think he literally means that it's a meteorite. Sometimes they're~used for accessories and stuff.

100274|0x007B11A9|It could also be a replica, so I can't judge right now whether it's~the real thing or not.

100280|0x007B1394|They're said to heighten spiritual, and supernatural powers. There's~also a theory that they've been objects of worship since ancient~times. Mayaka could probably tell you more about that.

100283|0x007B153F|Did you ever hear about a~meteorite being inside the~Astronomy Club's music box?
100284|0x007B15B9|First I've heard of it.
100285|0x007B15DB|First I've heard of it.
100286|0x007B1602|(Maybe that means it was hidden there.)
100287|0x007B1634|(Maybe that means it was hidden~there.)
100288|0x007B1685|When you go to souvenir shops and whatnot, they also sell meteorite~accessories like pendants, right?

100290|0x007B1776|Meteorites are a valuable mineral. So the ones you see at shops or at~auctions are oftentimes, pardon me for saying this, fake junk.

100296|0x007B19D7|From what you say, I'd imagine meteorites are quite pricey.
100297|0x007B1A1D|From what you say, I'd imagine~meteorites are quite pricey.
100298|0x007B1A74|Kinda depends on the type of meteorite. Cheap ones go for about 400~yen per gram.

100304|0x007B1CD3|I heard that someone once sold one whole meteorite from Mars for a~whopping 100,000,000 yen.

100307|0x007B1DDF|Okay, that's way beyond the~price of gold now.
100308|0x007B1E37|There are even meteor hunters who hunt meteorites for a living. After~all, it's said that upwards of 20,000 meteorites come down on Earth~over the course of one year.

100316|0x007B218D|Before taking it, I asked...
100317|0x007B21B4|Before taking it, I asked...
100318|0x007B21EA|Do you know how we might find out whether it's the real thing or not?

100321|0x007B22D2|Are you interested in knowing?
100322|0x007B230A|Well, I guess I'm more interested in knowing why it was inside the~music box.

100324|0x007B23D9|You don't know, right?

100329|0x007B24FF|This is the Astronomy Club's~symbol, right?
100330|0x007B2554|Yeah. It just sort of wound up that way over time. But this pendant is~unrelated.
100331|0x007B25B0|Yeah. It just sort of wound up~that way over time. But this~pendant is unrelated.
100332|0x007B2611|Presumably having seen through what I was getting at, he tacked on~that last bit.
100333|0x007B266D|Presumably having seen through~what I was getting at, he~tacked on that last bit.
100334|0x007B26E8|But why did it become the club's symbol in the first place? You make~it sound like it just sort of happened, but there's gotta be some~reason, right?
100335|0x007B2788|But why did it become the~club's symbol in the first~place? You make it sound like~it just sort of happened, but

100342|0x007B2941|When I go to get the music box repaired, I can ask whether it's a real~meteorite or not.

100346|0x007B2A89|Of course I don't mean me. I happen to know a certain someone that~could likely do a much better job than any music box store.

100353|0x007B2D09|I believe you've met him~yourself, Asuho.
100354|0x007B2D42|Then the boss finally told us.
100355|0x007B2D6B|Then the boss finally told us.
100356|0x007B2DD8|He was our adviser back when I was in the Astronomy Club...

100365|0x007B3090|...Is that what he said?
100366|0x007B30EC|Yeah. He said our former adviser would fix it.
100367|0x007B3125|Yeah. He said our former~adviser would fix it.

100374|0x007B33CE|He did, yeah. Apparently the former advisor was the one who crafted~the music box.
100375|0x007B342B|He did, yeah. Apparently the~former advisor was the one who~crafted the music box.
100376|0x007B348D|The dubious expression on Okaizumi-senpai's face made it clear that he~hadn't known that.

100380|0x007B35BD|Assuming he wasn't pulling our finger, then yeah.
100381|0x007B35F9|Assuming he wasn't pulling our~finger, then yeah.
100382|0x007B3654|But that would mean he never asked a specialist to fix it, and just~gave it back to me after judging that it can't be repaired on his own,~wouldn't it?
100383|0x007B36F6|But that would mean he never~asked a specialist to fix it,~and just gave it back to me~after judging that it can't be

100386|0x007B37D4|I guess it would.
100387|0x007B37F0|I guess it would.
100388|0x007B382B|If the one who made it claims it can't be repaired, doesn't that mean~it simply can't be fixed no matter what?

100404|0x007B3E28|Well, it seems like Okaizumi-senpai wasn't against it either. Besides,~I'm curious.

100406|0x007B3F03|About the pendant?
100407|0x007B3F20|About the pendant?
100408|0x007B3F4C|Yeah. And also the fact that the former adviser returned it to~Okaizumi-senpai without repairing it.

100415|0x007B410C|And you sure you didn't mean to~say he couldn't?
100416|0x007B4156|Yeah. If you think about it logically, it's pretty much impossible~that he can't repair it, right?

100418|0x007B424F|What makes you think so?

100640|0x007B9A10|I would be so very grateful if you would take responsibility by~letting me make breakfast instead of apologizing then giving me a~noogie right after!
100641|0x007B9AB0|I would be so very grateful if~you would take responsibility~by letting me make breakfast~instead of apologizing then
100642|0x007B9B76|That's enough barking. Just sit down and eat your breakfast already.

100644|0x007B9C33|Just you wait! Tomorrow I swear I'll absolutely, definitely,~positively make sure I get up earlier than you! Cross my heart, hope~to die, stick a needle in my eye!

100647|0x007B9D9B|I casually dismissed that~puffed up claim.
100648|0x007B9DD5|It was a fact, though, that she was getting up a little earlier every~day.
100649|0x007B9E2A|It was a fact, though, that she~was getting up a little earlier~every day.
100650|0x007B9E84|There might eventually come a day when Chinami gets up early enough to~make breakfast.
100651|0x007B9EE5|There might eventually come a~day when Chinami gets up early~enough to make breakfast.
100652|0x007B9F4B|So I reckoned I should start working out a plan to avoid that~catastrophe now.

100656|0x007BA10A|After we went on break with lunchtime over, Asuho's dad brought that~up while bringing us ice tea.
100657|0x007BA177|After we went on break with~lunchtime over, Asuho's dad~brought that up while bringing~us ice tea.
100658|0x007BA209|I asked him and he told me it was the real thing. He didn't tell me~how he was so sure, or how the pendant is related to the music box,~though.
100659|0x007BA2A3|I asked him and he told me it~was the real thing. He didn't~tell me how he was so sure, or~how the pendant is related to

100661|0x007BA386|Oh, you went and met him?

100668|0x007BA5AC|Do you think he can do it?
100669|0x007BA5D1|Do you think he can do it?
100670|0x007BA615|Well, I urged him to at least try. He said for now he'll hold onto it~and check its condition.
100671|0x007BA67E|Well, I urged him to at least~try. He said for now he'll hold~onto it and check its~condition.
100672|0x007BA706|I mean, he's already seen its condition plenty enough.
100673|0x007BA747|I mean, he's already seen its~condition plenty enough.
100674|0x007BA7A7|But he was also startled to see it in pieces like that.
100675|0x007BA7E9|But he was also startled to see~it in pieces like that.
100676|0x007BA84A|Oh, right. We kinda broke it even further.
100677|0x007BA87F|Oh, right. We kinda broke it~even further.
100678|0x007BA8C3|...Sorry. I really can't apologize enough.
100679|0x007BA8F8|...Sorry. I really can't~apologize enough.
100680|0x007BA94C|I'm sure it'll work out in the end! It's not like it's beyond~recognition.
100681|0x007BA9A1|I'm sure it'll work out in the~end! It's not like it's beyond~recognition.
100682|0x007BAA15|At any rate, it all hinges on his decision now.
100683|0x007BAA4F|At any rate, it all hinges on~his decision now.
100684|0x007BAA98|Any idea why he would be reluctant about repairing it?
100685|0x007BAAD9|Any idea why he would be~reluctant about repairing it?
100686|0x007BAB39|...You're saying he purposefully chose not to repair it?
100687|0x007BAB7C|...You're saying he~purposefully chose not to~repair it?
100688|0x007BABCE|Yeah, we think it's a real possibility.
100689|0x007BAC00|Yeah, we think it's a real~possibility.
100690|0x007BAC37|He contemplated that possibility for a moment.
100691|0x007BAC70|He contemplated that~possibility for a moment.
100692|0x007BACC8|Maybe he's busy and doesn't have the time.
100693|0x007BACFD|Maybe he's busy and doesn't~have the time.
100694|0x007BAD51|...That I highly doubt. He's not advising any clubs at the moment, for~one thing.
100695|0x007BADAD|...That I highly doubt. He's~not advising any clubs at the~moment, for one thing.
100696|0x007BAE28|And above all, things are different for him now, and he can devote~himself to teaching alone.

100698|0x007BAEFD|For some reason, it didn't quite sound right to say that he was~devoting himself to teaching alone.
100699|0x007BAF6B|For some reason, it didn't~quite sound right to say that~he was devoting himself to~teaching alone.
100700|0x007BB033|Umm! What are we talking about here?
100701|0x007BB062|Umm! What are we talking about~here?

100800|0x007BD370|Said it was just to go to the restroom. There's one in the club~building too, but since the team has a lotta members, you end up~having to wait a while.

100862|0x007BEC9E|...Look here, You-chan. Being concerned is fine, but are you sure you~should be so overprotective?
100863|0x007BED0B|...Look here, You-chan. Being~concerned is fine, but are you~sure you should be so~overprotective?
100864|0x007BED87|What I'm doing isn't called being overprotective.
100865|0x007BEDC3|What I'm doing isn't called~being overprotective.
100866|0x007BEE43|Yeah, whatever man. That's what any overprotective brother would say.
100867|0x007BEE93|Yeah, whatever man. That's what~any overprotective brother~would say.
100868|0x007BEEE8|First time someone's used that logic against me.

100870|0x007BEF7D|Just come along again and make sure nothin' happens. It's not that~complicated. Or what, are we gonna have to go through some stupid~argument like last time?

100875|0x007BF1C3|Never was gonna. After all,~we're getting it started~earlier than last time.
100876|0x007BF239|Should we invite Aoi-san and Suzuha-chan, too?
100877|0x007BF272|Should we invite Aoi-san and~Suzuha-chan, too?
100878|0x007BF2BA|It wouldn't hurt to ask.
100879|0x007BF2DD|It wouldn't hurt to ask.
100880|0x007BF31F|Looks like it's happening then. We'll meet up in front of the school~gate, and don't be late.

100888|0x007BF5FE|Guess I'll look for a good mobile game to waste time on while we're~there.

100897|0x007BF98F|Were they busy?
100898|0x007BF9B8|Apparently Suzuha-chan has a slight cold, so Aoi-san didn't want her~going out.

100902|0x007BFB34|It seemed like Suzuha-chan wanted to come! She was perfectly fine and~dandy!
100903|0x007BFB8B|It seemed like Suzuha-chan~wanted to come! She was~perfectly fine and dandy!
100904|0x007BFC01|I can see that. Aoi-san's also a little overprotective when it comes~to Suzuha-chan.
100905|0x007BFC60|I can see that. Aoi-san's also~a little overprotective when it~comes to Suzuha-chan.

100907|0x007BFCF6|...Why are you looking at me?
100908|0x007BFD63|Oh, by the way Chinami-chan, you decided not to bring your~bug-catching net?

100910|0x007BFE30|Unfortunately! I wanted to but gave up on it!

100940|0x007C0991|Apart from these tests of courage, I'd also snuck in to get Asuho's~telescope from the club room, and then there were also the times I~went to see Aoi-san on the rooftop.

100946|0x007C0C57|Logically thinking, there's only one place that comes to mind.

100948|0x007C0D2B|Asuka-kun, are we heading to the music room?
100949|0x007C0D62|Asuka-kun, are we heading to~the music room?
100950|0x007C0DD2|Not yet. First thing, we're gonna comb all the floors, and if we don't~find anything with that, then we'll stakeout in the music room.

100954|0x007C0F72|We can also peek in the gym since the baseball team's not lodging at~school.
100955|0x007C0FC9|We can also peek in the gym~since the baseball team's not~lodging at school.
100956|0x007C1030|Being very careful to keep our noise levels to a minimum, we tiptoed~down the dim hallway.

100958|0x007C112B|With the obvious exceptions of the staff room and the security's night~duty room, we checked everything on the first floor and found nothing~out of the ordinary.

100961|0x007C12BC|Next we advanced to the second~floor where the different~activity rooms were lined up.
100962|0x007C1322|This was the floor in question.
100963|0x007C134C|This was the floor in question.
100964|0x007C13E7|...Wait, holy crap. I can see a light on.
100965|0x007C141B|...Wait, holy crap. I can see a~light on.
100966|0x007C145E|Looks like it's from one of the rooms further down.
100967|0x007C149C|Looks like it's from one of the~rooms further down.
100968|0x007C151B|Isn't that room back there the music room?
100969|0x007C1550|Isn't that room back there the~music room?
100970|0x007C15C0|Well, I guess the music room is around there...
100971|0x007C15FA|Well, I guess the music room is~around there...
100972|0x007C1639|Out of nowhere, we actually hit the jackpot.
100973|0x007C1670|Out of nowhere, we actually hit~the jackpot.
100974|0x007C16B6|But I can't hear a piano playing.
100975|0x007C16E2|But I can't hear a piano~playing.
100976|0x007C172D|Maybe they got tired of playing and decided to take a break?

100978|0x007C17DA|That alien sure is a dedicated pianist!

100980|0x007C1879|...Wow, so none of you are gonna tuck tail and run.
100981|0x007C18B7|...Wow, so none of you are~gonna tuck tail and run.
100982|0x007C18FA|Since our resident scaredy-cat, Aoi-san, wasn't present today, this~whole thing didn't feel like a test of courage at all.

100984|0x007C1A13|Well, rationally speaking it's probably just a brass player in the~band who came to retrieve something they left behind.

100988|0x007C1BDF|Stop blabberin' guys, we need to check it. Who or what it is, it'll~all be clear once we look in that room.

100994|0x007C1F05|It could also be a security guard, so be super careful.
100995|0x007C1F47|It could also be a security~guard, so be super careful.
100996|0x007C1FC9|...Yeah, if we walked in on a security member we'd be done.
100997|0x007C200F|...Yeah, if we walked in on a~security member we'd be done.
100998|0x007C2092|Guess we're gonna just have to shoot a quick peek inside. If it seems~like someone's about to come out of the room, we make for the hills.
100999|0x007C2127|Guess we're gonna just have to~shoot a quick peek inside. If~it seems like someone's about~to come out of the room, we
101000|0x007C21EB|Oh no worries on that one! I can run as fast as a lightning bolt!
101001|0x007C2237|Oh no worries on that one! I~can run as fast as a lightning~bolt!
101002|0x007C22B6|Then, as we drew near to the room the light was leaking from, we~realized that we'd gotten it wrong all along.
101003|0x007C232F|Then, as we drew near to the~room the light was leaking~from, we realized that we'd~gotten it wrong all along.
101004|0x007C23E7|...So it wasn't the music room.
101005|0x007C2411|...So it wasn't the music room.
101006|0x007C245E|It was the AV room. In other words, our club room.
101007|0x007C249B|It was the AV room. In other~words, our club room.
101008|0x007C24DD|The room furthest in the back, which was right next to our club room~incidentally, was the music room.

101012|0x007C2684|Why are the lights on in our club room?
101013|0x007C26B6|Why are the lights on in our~club room?
101014|0x007C26F7|Maybe Okaizumi-senpai left something behind in the club room?
101015|0x007C273F|Maybe Okaizumi-senpai left~something behind in the club~room?
101016|0x007C27C2|Or get this! Maybe an alien's in there watching a movie!
101017|0x007C2805|Or get this! Maybe an alien's~in there watching a movie!
101018|0x007C2884|Which would mean our piano was actually just music from a movie...
101019|0x007C28D1|Which would mean our piano was~actually just music from a~movie...
101020|0x007C2923|Trying to picture this whole thing made for quite the comical image.
101021|0x007C2972|Trying to picture this whole~thing made for quite the~comical image.
101022|0x007C29D0|At any rate, nothing we can do but take a look inside.
101023|0x007C2A11|At any rate, nothing we can do~but take a look inside.
101024|0x007C2A8D|I put my hand on the sliding door.

101026|0x007C2B26|Careful now, Kogasaka.
101027|0x007C2B47|Careful now, Kogasaka.
101028|0x007C2BA2|If you startle the alien and it escapes, it's all gonna be your fault.~Just so you know, Onii-chan!

101031|0x007C2CF2|Come on, You-chan! The suspense~is killing me!
101032|0x007C2D30|With everyone closely sticking to the door, I quietly slid it open a~bit.
101033|0x007C2D84|With everyone closely sticking~to the door, I quietly slid it~open a bit.
101034|0x007C2E0E|Instantly, the lights went out.
101035|0x007C2E38|Instantly, the lights went out.
101036|0x007C2E67|Naturally, that startled me.
101037|0x007C2E8E|Naturally, that startled me.
101038|0x007C2EE3|Following that, I heard a door being slid open.
101039|0x007C2F1D|Following that, I heard a door~being slid open.
101040|0x007C2F62|It wasn't the one we were in front of, which could only mean it was~the one on the other side of the room.

101042|0x007C3051|I directed a sidelong glance towards that direction and spotted a~silhouette.
101043|0x007C30A9|I directed a sidelong glance~towards that direction and~spotted a silhouette.
101044|0x007C3106|After that, all sounds ceased and the figure kept still.

101046|0x007C3191|(...They didn't notice us?)
101047|0x007C31B7|(...They didn't notice us?)
101048|0x007C31E2|It was almost praiseworthy that no one had raised their voice. Had it~been the security, we would've been thrust into a game of tag right~then and there.

101050|0x007C330D|I couldn't make out the person's face. Not only were we a fair~distance apart, there was also the fact that only dim starlight shone~in from the window, preventing me from getting a clear view.

101055|0x007C34FA|We all held our breath.
101056|0x007C3521|I was worried that our two Occult Club members might've sprung at the~silhouette after deeming it an alien or a shinigami, but they stood~still just like me.

101074|0x007C3A86|(...There were two of them?)
101075|0x007C3AAD|(...There were two of them?)
101076|0x007C3AD9|Just like the first, I couldn't make out any facial features.
101077|0x007C3B21|Just like the first, I couldn't~make out any facial features.
101078|0x007C3B6E|This one, however, was much taller. The other one was relatively tiny,~so when next to each other they gave off the image of parent and~child.

101082|0x007C3D81|After we were sure they'd completely gone down the stairs, the tension~finally eased up.
101083|0x007C3DE4|After we were sure they'd~completely gone down the~stairs, the tension finally~eased up.
101084|0x007C3E80|Oh my god, oh my god! Onii-chan, Onii-chan! Did you see that?! There~were two insect aliens!
101085|0x007C3EE7|Oh my god, oh my god!~Onii-chan, Onii-chan! Did you~see that?! There were two~insect aliens!
101086|0x007C3F5D|How do you know they were insects?
101087|0x007C3F8A|How do you know they were~insects?
101088|0x007C3FE1|Because I'm gonna catch 'em with my handy dandy bug-catching net! And~after that we'll become best buddies!

101090|0x007C40D2|An action like that seems much more likely to anger them and ignite a~war, if you ask me.

101092|0x007C41D5|They looked like normal humans to me though... like a teacher and a~student.

101094|0x007C4292|At the very least, we can say that they're not security guards. I~mean, the way they acted didn't seem like a security guard catching an~intruder.

101098|0x007C44A5|Aye aye, sir! They went down the stairway just now, right?!

101106|0x007C47AC|Let's check the club room first. It could've been robbers.
101107|0x007C47F1|Let's check the club room~first. It could've been~robbers.
101108|0x007C4855|Oh God, that means my telescope might be─!
101109|0x007C488B|Oh God, that means my telescope~might be─!
101110|0x007C48C6|We went into the club room.
101111|0x007C48EC|We went into the club room.
101112|0x007C4936|We didn't turn on any lights, to avoid tipping off the security.
101113|0x007C4981|We didn't turn on any lights,~to avoid tipping off the~security.
101114|0x007C49D1|The starlight was dim, but it wasn't completely dark, so we could see~enough to find our way around.
101115|0x007C4A40|The starlight was dim, but it~wasn't completely dark, so we~could see enough to find our~way around.
101116|0x007C4AB4|Asuho made a beeline for the reference room and stormed inside.
101117|0x007C4AFE|Asuho made a beeline for the~reference room and stormed~inside.
101118|0x007C4B96|...It doesn't look like they ransacked the place.
101119|0x007C4BD2|...It doesn't look like they~ransacked the place.
101120|0x007C4C13|Figuring that there was nothing to worry about in here, I followed~after Asuho.
101121|0x007C4C6D|Figuring that there was nothing~to worry about in here, I~followed after Asuho.
101122|0x007C4D05|So?
101123|0x007C4D13|So?
101124|0x007C4D57|My telescope is safe. God, I was so worried there.
101125|0x007C4D94|My telescope is safe. God, I~was so worried there.
101126|0x007C4DE0|What about the rest?
101127|0x007C4DFF|What about the rest?
101128|0x007C4E3D|...Hard to confirm since it's so dark, but it looks like everything's~here.
101129|0x007C4E93|...Hard to confirm since it's~so dark, but it looks like~everything's here.
101130|0x007C4EEE|So, evidently, they weren't here to steal things.
101131|0x007C4F2A|So, evidently, they weren't~here to steal things.
101132|0x007C4F8B|So, like, about those mysterious figures. Do you think it's possible~they actually mistook us for the security and ran away?
101133|0x007C5012|So, like, about those~mysterious figures. Do you~think it's possible they~actually mistook us for the
101134|0x007C5091|It didn't seem like it. I mean, they sure didn't look to be in a hurry~or anything.
101135|0x007C50EF|It didn't seem like it. I mean,~they sure didn't look to be in~a hurry or anything.
101136|0x007C516C|But still, don't you think the timing is a little suspicious? I mean,~the exact moment we opened the door, the lights went out.
101137|0x007C51F6|But still, don't you think the~timing is a little suspicious?~I mean, the exact moment we~opened the door, the lights
101138|0x007C527B|She was right.
101139|0x007C5294|She was right.
101140|0x007C52B2|Maybe it was mere coincidence, or like Asuho said, something done~intentionally.
101141|0x007C530D|Maybe it was mere coincidence,~or like Asuho said, something~done intentionally.
101142|0x007C536D|However, I do know that I tried my damned best to make as little sound~as possible when I opened the door.
101143|0x007C53E2|However, I do know that I tried~my damned best to make as~little sound as possible when I~opened the door.
101144|0x007C545C|Even if I did happen to make noise, there's just no way they could've~reacted that quickly.
101145|0x007C54C2|Even if I did happen to make~noise, there's just no way they~could've reacted that quickly.
101146|0x007C552D|So if Asuho was on the right track, that would mean they noticed us~already before we even thought to look inside the room.
101147|0x007C55B3|So if Asuho was on the right~track, that would mean they~noticed us already before we~even thought to look inside the
101148|0x007C5652|Unexpected twist: what if it was actually Mare-chan.
101149|0x007C5691|Unexpected twist: what if it~was actually Mare-chan.
101150|0x007C56D5|Supposing it was Mare, it's possible she could've observed us as we~were walking down the hallway while invisible.

101152|0x007C57DE|Well, one of them kinda looked like her.
101153|0x007C5811|Well, one of them kinda looked~like her.
101154|0x007C5849|The shorter one, to be precise. However, I couldn't say for sure~whether her height was as small as Mare's.
101155|0x007C58BF|The shorter one, to be precise.~However, I couldn't say for~sure whether her height was as~small as Mare's.
101156|0x007C5944|But still, there's the other one we have to worry about, too.
101157|0x007C598C|But still, there's the other~one we have to worry about,~too.
101158|0x007C59F3|Maybe that was her older brother.
101159|0x007C5A1F|Maybe that was her older~brother.
101160|0x007C5A5A|She's told me before that she has no family.
101161|0x007C5A91|She's told me before that she~has no family.
101162|0x007C5AE7|...Really?
101163|0x007C5AFC|...Really?
101164|0x007C5B20|Well, I don't know whether that's actually true.
101165|0x007C5B5B|Well, I don't know whether~that's actually true.
101166|0x007C5B9B|Her name, Mare, was just an assumed name too.
101167|0x007C5BD3|Her name, Mare, was just an~assumed name too.
101168|0x007C5C1A|Shall we go back? I'm worried about the other two.
101169|0x007C5C57|Shall we go back? I'm worried~about the other two.
101170|0x007C5CB3|Right. I'd hate to find out that they got caught by the security.
101171|0x007C5CFF|Right. I'd hate to find out~that they got caught by the~security.
101172|0x007C5D50|Thereupon, we left the club room.
101173|0x007C5D7C|Thereupon, we left the club~room.
101174|0x007C5DF4|...Lost track of 'em after not too long.
101175|0x007C5E27|...Lost track of 'em after not~too long.
101176|0x007C5ECA|Maybe they got back on their UFO and returned to their home planet...
101177|0x007C5F1A|Maybe they got back on their~UFO and returned to their home~planet...
101178|0x007C5F6F|We joined up with them at the school's doorway, and walked out to the~gate all together.
101179|0x007C5FD2|We joined up with them at the~school's doorway, and walked~out to the gate all together.
101180|0x007C6044|Well, glad to see you didn't get caught.
101181|0x007C6077|Well, glad to see you didn't~get caught.
101182|0x007C60EE|You guys really should've thought before you went and ran off like~that.
101183|0x007C6141|You guys really should've~thought before you went and ran~off like that.
101184|0x007C61BE|That's a very tall order, Senpai! If it's for the worthy cause of~capturing aliens I'm prepared to overcome mountains, valleys, oceans~you name it!!
101185|0x007C625D|That's a very tall order,~Senpai! If it's for the worthy~cause of capturing aliens I'm~prepared to overcome mountains,
101186|0x007C6326|Asuho was worried sick about you and that's all you have to say?
101187|0x007C6371|Asuho was worried sick about~you and that's all you have to~say?
101188|0x007C6411|Oh God, Onii-chan, how can I possibly withstand this terrible~noogiee?!
101189|0x007C6463|Oh God, Onii-chan, how can I~possibly withstand this~terrible noogiee?!
101190|0x007C6514|I'm with Chinami-chan on this one. You'll never get anywhere if you~don't take risks.
101191|0x007C6574|I'm with Chinami-chan on this~one. You'll never get anywhere~if you don't take risks.
101192|0x007C65D9|So in summary: they were absolutely going to keep this nonsense going,~and I would be stuck babysitting Chinami each time.

101196|0x007C676F|You-chan sounds like he's worn out.
101197|0x007C679D|You-chan sounds like he's worn~out.
101198|0x007C6805|You're in such terrible shape! I'm disappointed, Onii-chan! I'm over~here still with stamina to overcome mountains, valleys, oceans, you~name it!!
101199|0x007C68A2|You're in such terrible shape!~I'm disappointed, Onii-chan!~I'm over here still with~stamina to overcome mountains,
101200|0x007C6962|Then give me some of that energy, why don't you.
101201|0x007C699D|Then give me some of that~energy, why don't you.
101202|0x007C6A2D|Noogies do not have the power to transfer energy, for the love of~God!!

101204|0x007C6B1D|So what's the plan, guys? Are we gonna go back in and finish our test~of courage?
101205|0x007C6B79|So what's the plan, guys? Are~we gonna go back in and finish~our test of courage?
101206|0x007C6C0F|Well, I wouldn't mind another stakeout.
101207|0x007C6C41|Well, I wouldn't mind another~stakeout.
101208|0x007C6C82|We could try that, but maybe not tonight. Go gather some more~witnesses, and we'll see if any interesting leads come up by tomorrow.
101209|0x007C6D11|We could try that, but maybe~not tonight. Go gather some~more witnesses, and we'll see~if any interesting leads come

101212|0x007C6E32|He read me like a book.
101213|0x007C6E54|He read me like a book.
101214|0x007C6E95|Eh, you got a point. It's a bit early, but I guess we'll call it a~night here.
101215|0x007C6EEE|Eh, you got a point. It's a bit~early, but I guess we'll call~it a night here.
101216|0x007C6F66|So just who were those people we saw?
101217|0x007C6F96|So just who were those people~we saw?
101218|0x007C6FE5|Some further rounds of questioning will be necessary to figure that~out, too.
101219|0x007C703D|Some further rounds of~questioning will be necessary~to figure that out, too.
101220|0x007C70A4|All right, time to go home then.
101221|0x007C70CF|All right, time to go home~then.
101222|0x007C7119|Right, thanks for coming out.
101223|0x007C7141|Right, thanks for coming out.
101224|0x007C7188|Of course! I had a blast.
101225|0x007C71AC|Of course! I had a blast.

101230|0x007C7395|I, however, turned and walked up the hill.

101232|0x007C7454|Found you, Mare.

101237|0x007C7514|What's wrong?
101238|0x007C754F|...It's kind of late, so I was already convinced you weren't gonna~come.
101239|0x007C75A2|...It's kind of late, so I was~already convinced you weren't~gonna come.
101240|0x007C75FA|Right. I'd come quite a bit later than usual.

101242|0x007C7679|Sorry for making you wait.

101250|0x007C783D|Know what a test of courage is?
101251|0x007C7867|Know what a test of courage is?
101252|0x007C78AE|Of course, I'm not stupid. You did one of those before.
101253|0x007C78F0|Of course, I'm not stupid. You~did one of those before.
101254|0x007C7941|Well, unfortunately we didn't see you there this time around.

101258|0x007C7A6B|Really?
101259|0x007C7A7D|Really?
101260|0x007C7AAC|...What makes you think I wasn't?
101261|0x007C7AD8|...What makes you think I~wasn't?
101262|0x007C7B09|If Mare wasn't at Hibari High, the shorter of the two shadowy figures~couldn't have been Mare.

101266|0x007C7C5F|...You ignored my question.
101267|0x007C7C85|...You ignored my question.
101268|0x007C7CBA|You can make yourself disappear, right?
101269|0x007C7CEC|You can make yourself~disappear, right?
101270|0x007C7D3B|That's right.
101271|0x007C7D53|That's right.
101272|0x007C7D7A|But you yourself don't even know how that actually works, correct?
101273|0x007C7DC7|But you yourself don't even~know how that actually works,~correct?
101274|0x007C7E31|That's right.
101275|0x007C7E49|That's right.
101276|0x007C7E70|For instance, can you move around while in that state?
101277|0x007C7EB1|For instance, can you move~around while in that state?
101278|0x007C7F0F|...What do you mean?
101279|0x007C7F2E|...What do you mean?
101280|0x007C7F5C|You once disappeared and then got behind me, right?
101281|0x007C7F9A|You once disappeared and then~got behind me, right?
101282|0x007C7FDD|After which she hit me with her scythe.
101283|0x007C800F|After which she hit me with her~scythe.
101284|0x007C805E|Yeah, what about it?
101285|0x007C807D|Yeah, what about it?
101286|0x007C80AB|Was that teleportation? Or did you just walk behind me after~disappearing?
101287|0x007C8100|Was that teleportation? Or did~you just walk behind me after~disappearing?
101288|0x007C8172|I just walked behind you.
101289|0x007C8196|I just walked behind you.

101529|0x007CCA22|Maybe that, or maybe they ain't~even a teacher at our school in~the first place.
101530|0x007CCA8C|So why did they think it was a teacher?
101531|0x007CCABE|So why did they think it was a~teacher?
101532|0x007CCB0F|Well, 'cause the person was wearing a suit. Normally the only people~you'd be seeing in suits around a school are teachers.
101533|0x007CCB95|Well, 'cause the person was~wearing a suit. Normally the~only people you'd be seeing in~suits around a school are
101534|0x007CCC4C|Oh I see! We can deduce from that that it's an alien who values~etiquette!
101535|0x007CCCA1|Oh I see! We can deduce from~that that it's an alien who~values etiquette!
101536|0x007CCD15|I can't rule out that possibility.
101537|0x007CCD42|I can't rule out that~possibility.
101538|0x007CCD8E|Then maybe we can be friends with them.
101539|0x007CCDC0|Then maybe we can be friends~with them.
101540|0x007CCE01|...Great, now you've joined the loony club too, Asuho.
101541|0x007CCE42|...Great, now you've joined the~loony club too, Asuho.
101542|0x007CCEC7|What's that supposed to mean?!
101543|0x007CCEF0|What's that supposed to mean?!
101544|0x007CCF55|The suit-wearing person was male, apparently. The girls who took him~for a teacher told him goodbye, upon which he replied curtly that they~should take care on their way home.
101545|0x007CD00F|The suit-wearing person was~male, apparently. The girls who~took him for a teacher told him~goodbye, upon which he replied
101546|0x007CD0B3|He wasn't too talkative, but overall I'd say that's the kind of thing~you'd expect a teacher to say.
101547|0x007CD122|He wasn't too talkative, but~overall I'd say that's the kind~of thing you'd expect a teacher~to say.
101548|0x007CD1CB|That alien has done a seriously great job of researching the behavior~of teachers!
101549|0x007CD228|That alien has done a seriously~great job of researching the~behavior of teachers!
101550|0x007CD2A4|So after that, the guy entered the AV room...
101551|0x007CD2DC|So after that, the guy entered~the AV room...
101552|0x007CD35A|And here's the interesting part. He entered alone.
101553|0x007CD397|And here's the interesting~part. He entered alone.
101554|0x007CD3D9|Evidently that was the end of the story.
101555|0x007CD40C|Evidently that was the end of~the story.
101556|0x007CD444|One of the two we saw yesterday had a tall stature. Probably a man's~figure.
101557|0x007CD49B|One of the two we saw yesterday~had a tall stature. Probably a~man's figure.
101558|0x007CD4F7|Maybe that teacher had stayed in the AV room, our Astro Club's club~room, due to some business he had to take care of in there at that~hour.
101559|0x007CD58E|Maybe that teacher had stayed~in the AV room, our Astro~Club's club room, due to some~business he had to take care of
101560|0x007CD647|The teacher was just by himself?
101561|0x007CD672|The teacher was just by~himself?
101562|0x007CD6BC|That's what they said, yeah.
101563|0x007CD6E3|That's what they said, yeah.
101564|0x007CD719|Then that only begs the question, who was that other person we saw?
101565|0x007CD767|Then that only begs the~question, who was that other~person we saw?
101566|0x007CD7D4|Assuming that teacher is an agent sent by the aliens, he may have~summoned his comrade where they then held a secret meeting in the AV~room.
101567|0x007CD86B|Assuming that teacher is an~agent sent by the aliens, he~may have summoned his comrade~where they then held a secret
101568|0x007CD924|And afterwards they got on their UFO and flew home! I know how it~goes!
101569|0x007CD976|And afterwards they got on~their UFO and flew home! I know~how it goes!
101570|0x007CD9CD|Those two felt like the real aliens to me.
101571|0x007CDA02|Those two felt like the real~aliens to me.
101572|0x007CDA73|...Do you truly believe that, Asuka-kun?
101573|0x007CDAA6|...Do you truly believe that,~Asuka-kun?
101574|0x007CDADE|Asuho, though, still remained in the world of reality just like me.
101575|0x007CDB2C|Asuho, though, still remained~in the world of reality just~like me.
101576|0x007CDB99|Nah, just a wishful desire of mine. I mean, to me I don't care whether~it's an alien or a shinigami of love.
101577|0x007CDC10|Nah, just a wishful desire of~mine. I mean, to me I don't~care whether it's an alien or a~shinigami of love.
101578|0x007CDC96|As long as you can come out saying you had a supernatural experience,~that's all you want?
101579|0x007CDCFB|As long as you can come out~saying you had a supernatural~experience, that's all you~want?
101580|0x007CDD7F|Get it right. I wanna take a picture of one so I can prove to the~world the supernatural exists.
101581|0x007CDDEA|Get it right. I wanna take a~picture of one so I can prove~to the world the supernatural~exists.
101582|0x007CDE64|I've always wanted to ask you this question just once, but why are you~so into this crap?
101583|0x007CDEC8|I've always wanted to ask you~this question just once, but~why are you so into this crap?
101584|0x007CDF4B|People don't need a reason to love or hate something.
101585|0x007CDF8B|People don't need a reason to~love or hate something.
101586|0x007CDFEA|But there's gotta be something that initially got you interested in~it, right? Like, in my case I started to love astronomy because of my~dad.

101590|0x007CE1BC|What's your motivation?

101594|0x007CE29C|Right.
101595|0x007CE2AD|Right.
101596|0x007CE2E3|Well, thing is, my little sister got abducted by aliens.
101597|0x007CE326|Well, thing is, my little~sister got abducted by aliens.
101598|0x007CE36E|Hearing the response he gave in such a low, solemn tone left me~utterly speechless.

101610|0x007CE741|Occult Prez! I'm sure she is only taking a bit longer than usual to~return home 'cause she's having so much fun playing with the aliens!~She'll come back for sure! And of course being a fellow Occult Club~member I'll help you look for her!

101614|0x007CE92D|Chinami's cheerful mood washed away the negative atmosphere with ease.
101615|0x007CE97E|Chinami's cheerful mood washed~away the negative atmosphere~with ease.
101616|0x007CE9D4|I was thankful for that, and maybe Asuka was as well.
101617|0x007CEA14|I was thankful for that, and~maybe Asuka was as well.
101618|0x007CEA59|Truth be told, she might actually have been a good asset as Asuka's~fellow member in the Occult Club.

101680|0x007CFFC1|No, don't listen to her. She's just being a goofball.

101688|0x007D02F8|Yep. I believe I told you guys what our iteration of it was.

101692|0x007D04EF|Which is why he started to wish that his girlfriend would forget all~about him.
101693|0x007D0549|Which is why he started to wish~that his girlfriend would~forget all about him.
101694|0x007D05B4|Heeding that wish, the shinigami appeared and robbed the girl of the~boy's memories.
101695|0x007D0613|Heeding that wish, the~shinigami appeared and robbed~the girl of the boy's memories.
101696|0x007D0683|Since it's a shinigami, I reckon you'd say it reaped the memories of~her romance with him. Anyway after that, the two thus broke up.

101702|0x007D0938|I can't say anything about Shino, but since Mayaka was the heiress to~their shrine and all, she was sort of our resident expert on the~supernatural back then.

101704|0x007D0AC6|Say Asuka, why not try asking Mayaka-san about it? She's the head~priestess of a shrine, so she's bound to know a lot when it comes to~the supernatural.
101705|0x007D0B69|Say Asuka, why not try asking~Mayaka-san about it? She's the~head priestess of a shrine, so~she's bound to know a lot when

101739|0x007D16CD|...Hrm.
101740|0x007D16FE|If I had to say, then I suppose I did believe in it. Though I never~felt like solving it.

101743|0x007D17EC|Why is that?
101744|0x007D1822|Because we weren't the target, I guess.
101745|0x007D1854|Because we weren't the target,~I guess.
101746|0x007D18A5|I'm positive the mystery behind the urban legend's one that ought to~be tackled by your generation, rather than ours.

101973|0x007D696C|Like the answer to whether~aliens exist?
101974|0x007D69AE|Of course not, birdbrain. It's clearly about whether the shinigami of~love exists or not.

102020|0x007D7B0A|It's the God of Stars in Japanese mythology. Fella's quite the~violent, belligerent deity at that. The tale goes that the other~deities tried to make him submit, but ultimately failed to do so.

102032|0x007D8067|But on a personal level, it's difficult to say one or the other. Just~like wars between humans, wars between the gods can't be measured in~good or evil.

102418|0x007DFEB7|It's really quiet...
102419|0x007DFED6|It's really quiet...
102420|0x007DFF04|Yeah.
102421|0x007DFF14|Yeah.
102422|0x007DFF43|It's the perfect kind of atmosphere where you'd expect an alien to~just pop out...
102423|0x007DFFA0|It's the perfect kind of~atmosphere where you'd expect~an alien to just pop out...
102424|0x007E000C|Most people would expect a ghost rather than an alien.
102425|0x007E004D|Most people would expect a~ghost rather than an alien.
102426|0x007E00AD|Think Occult Prez and Asuho-senpai are already inside?
102427|0x007E00EE|Think Occult Prez and~Asuho-senpai are already~inside?
102428|0x007E013E|Could be. Let's go after them.
102429|0x007E0167|Could be. Let's go after them.
102430|0x007E01BA|Okay!
102431|0x007E01CA|Okay!
102432|0x007E01DF|Perhaps I should've messaged them before that, but I didn't.
102433|0x007E0226|Perhaps I should've messaged~them before that, but I didn't.
102434|0x007E0272|Above all else, I just didn't want to stay still. I didn't want to get~a reply saying to wait for them to come back.
102435|0x007E02F1|Above all else, I just didn't~want to stay still. I didn't~want to get a reply saying to~wait for them to come back.
102436|0x007E0375|Taking along Chinami, I made for the school building.
102437|0x007E03B5|Taking along Chinami, I made~for the school building.
102438|0x007E042A|We kept moving forward, although we had to be careful not to let our~footsteps echo.
102439|0x007E0489|We kept moving forward,~although we had to be careful~not to let our footsteps echo.
102440|0x007E04ED|There was no sign of anyone else around.
102441|0x007E0520|There was no sign of anyone~else around.
102442|0x007E0558|Though I couldn't see ahead very far, so that didn't mean that Asuka~and Asuho weren't here on the first floor.
102443|0x007E05D2|Though I couldn't see ahead~very far, so that didn't mean~that Asuka and Asuho weren't~here on the first floor.
102444|0x007E065B|I shouldn't have to say this, but make sure you're quiet.
102445|0x007E069F|I shouldn't have to say this,~but make sure you're quiet.
102446|0x007E0719|Duh! I know that! I've become an absolute test of courage veteran by~now!
102447|0x007E076D|Duh! I know that! I've become~an absolute test of courage~veteran by now!
102448|0x007E07E2|I wonder what Chinami thought about it?
102449|0x007E0814|I wonder what Chinami thought~about it?
102450|0x007E084B|What did she think about me working?
102451|0x007E087A|What did she think about me~working?
102452|0x007E08AE|Did she know I'd probably end up hurting Shino-san if she knew?
102453|0x007E08F8|Did she know I'd probably end~up hurting Shino-san if she~knew?
102454|0x007E0947|But well, she wouldn't have started to work too if she did. I guess~she was in the same boat as me.
102455|0x007E09B5|But well, she wouldn't have~started to work too if she did.~I guess she was in the same~boat as me.
102456|0x007E0A28|...On second thought, no, the premise itself was entirely different.
102457|0x007E0A77|...On second thought, no, the~premise itself was entirely~different.
102458|0x007E0ACB|We weren't in the same boat. Our objectives weren't the same.
102459|0x007E0B13|We weren't in the same boat.~Our objectives weren't the~same.
102460|0x007E0B60|Chinami did it for herself.
102461|0x007E0B86|Chinami did it for herself.
102462|0x007E0BB1|And I did it for Shino-san.
102463|0x007E0BD7|And I did it for Shino-san.
102464|0x007E0C02|Maybe that decisive difference was the answer to everything.
102465|0x007E0C49|Maybe that decisive difference~was the answer to everything.
102466|0x007E0CC6|...I don't see anybody.
102467|0x007E0CE8|...I don't see anybody.
102468|0x007E0D0F|We'd reached the end of the hallway.
102469|0x007E0D3E|We'd reached the end of the~hallway.
102470|0x007E0D7C|Well, the room in the rumor is the AV room, so maybe they went there.
102471|0x007E0DCC|Well, the room in the rumor is~the AV room, so maybe they went~there.
102472|0x007E0E21|It just didn't sit well with me as an Astro Club member to have our~club room be haunted.
102473|0x007E0E85|It just didn't sit well with me~as an Astro Club member to have~our club room be haunted.
102474|0x007E0EEE|This whole ordeal would all be resolved if we just figured out who~those mysterious two people were.
102475|0x007E0F5D|This whole ordeal would all be~resolved if we just figured out~who those mysterious two people~were.
102476|0x007E0FD1|If they were actually those 'Star Gods' Mayaka mentioned, I think from~the Astro Club's point of view, that'd be greater than aliens and~ghosts.
102477|0x007E106C|If they were actually those~'Star Gods' Mayaka mentioned, I~think from the Astro Club's~point of view, that'd be
102478|0x007E1111|All right, second floor here we come!
102479|0x007E1141|All right, second floor here we~come!
102480|0x007E1176|I just wished this so-called test of courage veteran would keep her~volume down.
102481|0x007E11D1|I just wished this so-called~test of courage veteran would~keep her volume down.
102482|0x007E1273|As we reached the second floor, my cellphone, in silent mode,~vibrated.
102483|0x007E12C5|As we reached the second floor,~my cellphone, in silent mode,~vibrated.
102484|0x007E1347|It was a message from Asuho.
102485|0x007E136E|It was a message from Asuho.
102486|0x007E139A|They'd been waiting for us to arrive, but apparently spotted someone~seeming to be from the security at the school gate and then ran away~in direction of the lookout.
102487|0x007E144B|They'd been waiting for us to~arrive, but apparently spotted~someone seeming to be from the~security at the school gate and
102488|0x007E14D6|Now they were waiting for us in front of the school gate.
102489|0x007E151A|Now they were waiting for us in~front of the school gate.
102490|0x007E159C|That's what they said, Chinami. Shall we go back?
102491|0x007E15D8|That's what they said, Chinami.~Shall we go back?
102492|0x007E1625|......

102494|0x007E1656|Chinami?
102495|0x007E1669|Chinami?
102496|0x007E1681|Chinami was staring down the hallway.
102497|0x007E16B1|Chinami was staring down the~hallway.
102498|0x007E16E6|At the end of the hallway was the music room.
102499|0x007E171E|At the end of the hallway was~the music room.
102500|0x007E175B|And right before it was our club room.
102501|0x007E178C|And right before it was our~club room.
102502|0x007E17D5|Chinami walked on totteringly.
102503|0x007E17FE|Chinami walked on totteringly.
102504|0x007E1836|Get back here, Chinami...
102505|0x007E185A|Get back here, Chinami...
102506|0x007E18C9|...Dad.
102507|0x007E18DB|...Dad.
102508|0x007E18F2|It was an absentminded mutter.
102509|0x007E191B|It was an absentminded mutter.
102510|0x007E1949|She stopped walking right away.
102511|0x007E1973|She stopped walking right away.
102512|0x007E19C9|H... Huh...?
102513|0x007E19E0|H... Huh...?
102514|0x007E19FC|She looked around restlessly.
102515|0x007E1A24|She looked around restlessly.
102516|0x007E1A5B|...What's the matter?
102517|0x007E1A7B|...What's the matter?
102518|0x007E1AA0|With her eyes cast down, she told me.
102519|0x007E1AD0|With her eyes cast down, she~told me.
102520|0x007E1B1F|I heard it...
102521|0x007E1B37|I heard it...
102522|0x007E1B6E|I don't know where, but I could hear it...
102523|0x007E1BA3|I don't know where, but I could~hear it...
102524|0x007E1BE9|The sound of the music box...
102525|0x007E1C11|The sound of the music box...
102526|0x007E1C58|The tune of the music box we made together...
102527|0x007E1C90|The tune of the music box we~made together...
102528|0x007E1CEB|Chinami looked around one more time.
102529|0x007E1D1A|Chinami looked around one more~time.
102530|0x007E1D4E|The starlight shining through the windows crossed through our silence.
102531|0x007E1D9F|The starlight shining through~the windows crossed through our~silence.
102532|0x007E1E25|...I can't hear anything. Are you sure you didn't just imagine it?
102533|0x007E1E72|...I can't hear anything. Are~you sure you didn't just~imagine it?
102534|0x007E1EC4|Chinami shook her head.
102535|0x007E1EE6|Chinami shook her head.
102536|0x007E1F19|I heard it, I swear... just a few seconds ago...
102537|0x007E1F54|I heard it, I swear... just a~few seconds ago...
102538|0x007E1FAE|There's no way it's not...
102539|0x007E1FD3|There's no way it's not...
102540|0x007E2017|I mean I listen to that tune every day...
102541|0x007E204B|I mean I listen to that tune~every day...
102542|0x007E2084|Chinami had now calmed down and gone quiet.
102543|0x007E20BA|Chinami had now calmed down and~gone quiet.
102544|0x007E20F5|Her weapons-grade cheerfulness had disappeared.
102545|0x007E212F|Her weapons-grade cheerfulness~had disappeared.
102546|0x007E216E|I narrowed my eyes and stared at the other end of the dim hallway.
102547|0x007E21BB|I narrowed my eyes and stared~at the other end of the dim~hallway.
102548|0x007E2217|You heard a music box playing?

102554|0x007E234C|Yeah...
102555|0x007E235E|Yeah...
102556|0x007E2375|We didn't know the title of that piece.
102557|0x007E23A7|We didn't know the title of~that piece.
102558|0x007E23DE|It wasn't written on the score that we used.
102559|0x007E2415|It wasn't written on the score~that we used.
102560|0x007E2451|It was a special, personal tune. One that very few people knew of.
102561|0x007E249E|It was a special, personal~tune. One that very few people~knew of.
102562|0x007E24F0|The reason being, it was Chinami's father who composed it. Someone who~was no longer with us.
102563|0x007E2558|The reason being, it was~Chinami's father who composed~it. Someone who was no longer~with us.
102564|0x007E25CF|You're sure of it?
102565|0x007E25EC|You're sure of it?
102566|0x007E261A|Yeah...

102568|0x007E264D|Let's check it out then.
102569|0x007E2670|Let's check it out then.
102570|0x007E26A6|Chinami blinked her eyes in surprise.
102571|0x007E26D6|Chinami blinked her eyes in~surprise.
102572|0x007E2715|Let's go to the club room. It'll only take a few seconds to check it~out.
102573|0x007E2769|Let's go to the club room.~It'll only take a few seconds~to check it out.
102574|0x007E27C2|I figured that we weren't making Asuho and the others wait much longer~if we just took a peek.
102575|0x007E282B|I figured that we weren't~making Asuho and the others~wait much longer if we just~took a peek.
102576|0x007E28A3|We might be able to meet some of the ghosts you love so much.
102577|0x007E28EB|We might be able to meet some~of the ghosts you love so much.
102578|0x007E295D|My love is for aliens! Get it right!
102579|0x007E298C|My love is for aliens! Get it~right!
102580|0x007E29CA|Sorry. How could I forget?
102581|0x007E29EF|Sorry. How could I forget?
102582|0x007E2A3C|I gave her a light pat on the head.
102583|0x007E2A6A|I gave her a light pat on the~head.
102584|0x007E2AB9|If there was another music box out there that played this unique~tune...
102585|0x007E2B0C|If there was another music box~out there that played this~unique tune...
102586|0x007E2B64|Then maybe the ghost of Chinami's father made it.
102587|0x007E2BA0|Then maybe the ghost of~Chinami's father made it.
102588|0x007E2BEC|After a little bit of walking, we could see that there was definitely~light leaking out to the hallway from our club room.
102589|0x007E2C71|After a little bit of walking,~we could see that there was~definitely light leaking out to~the hallway from our club room.

102596|0x007E2F48|...Again? Sheesh, that makes the third day in a row.
102597|0x007E2F87|...Again? Sheesh, that makes~the third day in a row.
102598|0x007E2FE7|I would say it wasn't a wise idea to play the music box...
102599|0x007E302C|I would say it wasn't a wise~idea to play the music box...
102600|0x007E3092|How am I supposed to repair the thing without checking to see if it~works?
102601|0x007E30E7|How am I supposed to repair the~thing without checking to see~if it works?
102602|0x007E3172|Are you done repairing it...?
102603|0x007E319A|Are you done repairing it...?
102604|0x007E31E3|Not completely. Though it's already playing its piece.
102605|0x007E3224|Not completely. Though it's~already playing its piece.
102606|0x007E3286|I would advise you to put off the rest for later...

102631|0x007E38FC|Maybe you shouldn't work on it~here in the club room if you're~ultimately going to run...

102932|0x007E832F|I understand how she felt back then.
102933|0x007E835E|I understand how she felt back~then.
102934|0x007E83AC|I've come to understand how it feels to actually be a parent... why~logic doesn't always help...
102935|0x007E8417|I've come to understand how it~feels to actually be a~parent... why logic doesn't~always help...
102936|0x007E84F9|It's not the children's job to make guarantees, but their parent's...
102937|0x007E8549|It's not the children's job to~make guarantees, but their~parent's...
102938|0x007E85AA|I think that's what family is...
102939|0x007E85D5|I think that's what family~is...
102940|0x007E8605|That smile of hers, so lonely and solemn.

102942|0x007E868C|I often work through the night, as you know.

102960|0x007E8ACD|Like I said, you did nothing wrong.
102961|0x007E8AFB|Like I said, you did nothing~wrong.
102962|0x007E8B3A|Besides, we still have all the time in the world to grow as a family.
102963|0x007E8B8A|Besides, we still have all the~time in the world to grow as a~family.
102964|0x007E8BF9|We can talk more, have more meals together, laugh, smile, and even~grieve together.
102965|0x007E8C57|We can talk more, have more~meals together, laugh, smile,~and even grieve together.
102966|0x007E8CD4|We can even take baths together if you want.
102967|0x007E8D0B|We can even take baths together~if you want.

102979|0x007E900D|People always used to tell me I~was prone to flights of~fancy...
102980|0x007E9077|Am I once again being overly optimistic?

102982|0x007E90EC|...Maybe you are.
102983|0x007E9108|...Maybe you are.
102984|0x007E9129|She was smiling.
102985|0x007E9144|She was smiling.
102986|0x007E9164|I have to wonder if I managed a smile, too.
102987|0x007E919A|I have to wonder if I managed a~smile, too.
102988|0x007E91DF|But, you know, maybe that's just what we need.
102989|0x007E9218|But, you know, maybe that's~just what we need.
102990|0x007E9260|Maybe a bit of optimism is just what novices like us need to grow as a~family.

102992|0x007E9331|Will you let me take over watching after Chinami-chan?

102994|0x007E93C2|Yeah.
102995|0x007E93D2|Yeah.
102996|0x007E93E7|I got up and went on without averting my eyes.
102997|0x007E9420|I got up and went on without~averting my eyes.
102998|0x007E9468|To be honest, I don't think I'd let anyone other than you do this.
102999|0x007E94B5|To be honest, I don't think I'd~let anyone other than you do~this.
103000|0x007E951D|Then, I had a dream.
103001|0x007E953C|Then, I had a dream.
103002|0x007E957F|I turned off the lights in my room, got into my bed, and fell right~asleep, as I was probably a lot more tired than I thought.

103004|0x007E968D|I felt like I could leave Chinami to Shino-san. Maybe the relief that~stemmed from that was quite large.

103006|0x007E9778|I had a dream about my family.

103008|0x007E97EE|During my childhood, it was July when we moved away from Hibarigasaki.

103015|0x007E9B28|The same was true for Chinami.
103016|0x007E9B56|No matter how good she eventually became at making friends, at that~point in her childhood she was completely different.

103018|0x007E9C56|She was a complete introvert, like Suzuha-chan.
103019|0x007E9C90|She was a complete introvert,~like Suzuha-chan.
103020|0x007E9CCF|Maybe part of the reason why she was always so caring to Suzuha-chan~is because she saw her old self in that girl.
103021|0x007E9D4C|Maybe part of the reason why~she was always so caring to~Suzuha-chan is because she saw~her old self in that girl.
103022|0x007E9DCE|Of course, just like now, Chinami always tried to help with housework~and caused disasters in the process. That part of her, at least, has~always been the same.
103023|0x007E9E79|Of course, just like now,~Chinami always tried to help~with housework and caused~disasters in the process. That
103024|0x007E9EF8|When she entered her rebellious phase and stopped helping out with~housework, that was in a sense the most peaceful time of my life.

103028|0x007EA133|Chinami began to make her own music box.
103029|0x007EA166|Chinami began to make her own~music box.
103030|0x007EA1BB|Still without any playmates at school, Chinami needed something to~occupy herself with.
103031|0x007EA21D|Still without any playmates at~school, Chinami needed~something to occupy herself~with.
103032|0x007EA284|Maybe that's what Mom thought.
103033|0x007EA2AD|Maybe that's what Mom thought.
103034|0x007EA2DB|She was the one who passed Chinami, who was all by herself, a musical~score.
103035|0x007EA332|She was the one who passed~Chinami, who was all by~herself, a musical score.
103036|0x007EA38E|Then she told her to try and craft a music box using that score.

103038|0x007EA429|Our mom had intended to help her out too, but as Chinami was still in~the middle of her rebellious phase, she wouldn't have it and insisted~she could do it by herself.

103042|0x007EA692|After receiving the score plus a kit for making a music box, she~secluded herself inside her room and worked on it fervently.

103044|0x007EA79C|She was clearly having difficulties.
103045|0x007EA7CB|She was clearly having~difficulties.
103046|0x007EA7FF|Chinami has never been very dextrous. Her blundering attempts at~housework prove that.

103050|0x007EA989|The only time I saw her was when she came to eat.

103052|0x007EAA06|I remember wondering just how long it was going to take her to finish~that stupid thing.
103053|0x007EAA69|I remember wondering just how~long it was going to take her~to finish that stupid thing.
103054|0x007EAAD1|Eventually, unable to bear remaining idle any longer, I went inside~her room without asking.
103055|0x007EAB38|Eventually, unable to bear~remaining idle any longer, I~went inside her room without~asking.
103056|0x007EABA4|She was naturally surprised by my sudden appearance.

103061|0x007EAC9F|She screamed at me to get out.
103062|0x007EACCD|And I refused.

103066|0x007EAD61|And I just told her to shut up.
103067|0x007EAD8B|And I just told her to shut up.
103068|0x007EADBA|That's when she told me that she hated me.
103069|0x007EADEF|That's when she told me that~she hated me.

103072|0x007EAECA|Chinami said nothing back.

103076|0x007EAFB4|I just silently helped her while she was working on the music box.

103082|0x007EB1F4|Out of a yearning for her father?

103084|0x007EB251|Somehow I couldn't bring myself to believe it was only that.
103085|0x007EB298|Somehow I couldn't bring myself~to believe it was only that.
103086|0x007EB2E4|Apparently music composition was her dad's hobby even back when he was~in school.

103088|0x007EB3A1|I hear he played piano since a young age, and that's what sparked him~to take up composing.

103124|0x007EBED6|She had truly loved Chinami's father, from the bottom of her heart.

103766|0x007F6E20|She had heard that Chinami made it in elementary school back in the~city, but it looked older and more worn out than its actual age would~have you believe. Shino figured that was evidence of how often Chinami~used it.

103784|0x007F74CA|She figured she would first of all check out the brass band, since her~older sister Kasumi was in it. It was when she visited the music room~that she found the boy playing that piece.

103787|0x007F7643|Maybe Shino was enchanted by~that tune.
103788|0x007F767A|She learned that he wasn't actually in the brass band, but rather the~Astronomy Club.
103789|0x007F76DA|She learned that he wasn't~actually in the brass band, but~rather the Astronomy Club.
103790|0x007F773F|So Shino chased after him and joined the Astronomy Club.

103925|0x007F988B|I was useless and clumsy so I~could never help with~anything...
103926|0x007F98E6|That's why I decided to change my approach...
103927|0x007F991E|That's why I decided to change~my approach...

104043|0x007FB8A9|Well, if she started whining~about it, I'd just have to~skillfully coax her into it.

104058|0x007FBE01|What was that kiss all about?
104059|0x007FBE29|What was that kiss all about?
