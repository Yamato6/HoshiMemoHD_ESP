65665|0x0052D4C7|Yep. The one and only first~magnitude of fall's night sky.

65722|0x0052E464|But then, why did I need to confirm it? Well, that's because Asuho was~clearly trying to hide this fact which I had now come to suspect more~and more.

66353|0x00539DB2|Why couldn't I chase after~Asuho, even though I no longer~loved the girl from the~lookout?
66354|0x00539E26|Damn it all...
66355|0x00539E3F|Damn it all...
66356|0x00539E5D|...Chasing after her was pointless.
66357|0x00539E8B|...Chasing after her was~pointless.
66358|0x00539EBE|I'd always believed that nothing could tear me and Asuho apart.
66359|0x00539F08|I'd always believed that~nothing could tear me and Asuho~apart.
66360|0x00539F57|But, in reality, there was something there laying in wait from the~very beginning.

66362|0x0053A016|The girl from the lookout.
66363|0x0053A03B|The girl from the lookout.
66364|0x0053A065|It was her.
66365|0x0053A07B|It was her.
66366|0x0053A096|No matter what I said, Asuho wouldn't believe it.
66367|0x0053A0D2|No matter what I said, Asuho~wouldn't believe it.
66368|0x0053A113|As long as the girl from the lookout remained alive inside of me, she~would never believe me.
66369|0x0053A17B|As long as the girl from the~lookout remained alive inside~of me, she would never believe~me.
66370|0x0053A1E8|Asuho only interpreted what I did as acts of consideration or pity,~not acts of genuine love.
66371|0x0053A250|Asuho only interpreted what I~did as acts of consideration or~pity, not acts of genuine love.
66372|0x0053A2C7|Fucking hell...!
66373|0x0053A2E2|Fucking hell...!
66374|0x0053A329|I kicked the guardrail nearby, making it rock audibly.
66375|0x0053A36A|I kicked the guardrail nearby,~making it rock audibly.
66376|0x0053A3B0|My foot went numb, and at the same time my head grew hot.
66377|0x0053A3F4|My foot went numb, and at the~same time my head grew hot.
66378|0x0053A43D|So hot I felt like I was burning up.
66379|0x0053A46C|So hot I felt like I was~burning up.
66380|0x0053A4A0|(...Wait. This is a tad too hot for just blood rushing to the head.)
66381|0x0053A4EF|(...Wait. This is a tad too hot~for just blood rushing to the~head.)
66382|0x0053A58F|BAAW!

66384|0x0053A5E5|Hot! Hot! Hot!
66385|0x0053A5FF|Hot! Hot! Hot!
66386|0x0053A65E|A little dragon I hadn't seen in quite a while was circling above my~head.
66387|0x0053A6B3|A little dragon I hadn't seen~in quite a while was circling~above my head.
66388|0x0053A71F|Why do you look so sad?

66390|0x0053A768|I hadn't heard that voice in quite a while.
66391|0x0053A79E|I hadn't heard that voice in~quite a while.
66392|0x0053A81E|...You were watching us, Mare?

66394|0x0053A88D|Uh-huh.
66395|0x0053A89F|Uh-huh.
66396|0x0053A8B6|The shinigami, who I hadn't seen lately, finally decided to show~herself.
66397|0x0053A90A|The shinigami, who I hadn't~seen lately, finally decided to~show herself.
66398|0x0053A97B|You-kun. Why do you look so sad?
66399|0x0053A9A6|You-kun. Why do you look so~sad?
66400|0x0053A9D6|Mare repeated her question.
66401|0x0053A9FC|Mare repeated her question.
66402|0x0053AA3F|You looked so sad that you left me no choice but to come out.
66403|0x0053AA87|You looked so sad that you left~me no choice but to come out.
66404|0x0053AADE|...Well, I imagine it must have been hard to approach me.
66405|0x0053AB22|...Well, I imagine it must have~been hard to approach me.
66406|0x0053AB6B|My current situation was a disaster that no bystander would willingly~involve themselves in.
66407|0x0053ABD2|My current situation was a~disaster that no bystander~would willingly involve~themselves in.
66408|0x0053AC56|I told myself I wouldn't see you again...
66409|0x0053AC8A|I told myself I wouldn't see~you again...
66410|0x0053ACC3|She suddenly said...

66412|0x0053AD10|...What do you mean?
66413|0x0053AD2F|...What do you mean?
66414|0x0053AD6B|I mean saying goodbye forever.
66415|0x0053AD94|I mean saying goodbye forever.
66416|0x0053ADCC|Wait... Why?
66417|0x0053ADE3|Wait... Why?
66418|0x0053AE17|Because I have to.
66419|0x0053AE34|Because I have to.
66420|0x0053AE60|...Are you moving?
66421|0x0053AE7D|...Are you moving?
66422|0x0053AEB7|Something like that.

66424|0x0053AF04|When?
66425|0x0053AF14|When?
66426|0x0053AF41|Soon.
66427|0x0053AF51|Soon.
66428|0x0053AF70|Could I pat your head one more time, as a bit of a parting gift?
66429|0x0053AFBB|Could I pat your head one more~time, as a bit of a parting~gift?
66430|0x0053B023|...Do it and I'll reap you.

66432|0x0053B07E|Sure, go right ahead.
66433|0x0053B09E|Sure, go right ahead.
66434|0x0053B0D1|Mare stared at me blankly.
66435|0x0053B0F6|Mare stared at me blankly.
66436|0x0053B12A|I'm really glad I got to you see you tonight. Almost feels like fate.
66437|0x0053B17A|I'm really glad I got to you~see you tonight. Almost feels~like fate.
66438|0x0053B1E7|...Don't say stuff that makes my heart skip a beat.

66440|0x0053B278|Mare.
66441|0x0053B288|Mare.
66442|0x0053B29D|I felt like I was clinging to my last shred of hope as I asked her...
66443|0x0053B2ED|I felt like I was clinging to~my last shred of hope as I~asked her...
66444|0x0053B352|Please reap my nightmare with your scythe.
66445|0x0053B387|Please reap my nightmare with~your scythe.
66446|0x0053B3D9|...Huh?
66447|0x0053B3EB|...Huh?
66448|0x0053B40C|Reap my memories like you did before.
66449|0x0053B43C|Reap my memories like you did~before.
66450|0x0053B47B|I want you to reap my memories of the girl from the lookout.
66451|0x0053B4C2|I want you to reap my memories~of the girl from the lookout.
66452|0x0053B50E|Mare looked at me suspiciously.
66453|0x0053B538|Mare looked at me suspiciously.
66454|0x0053B57F|What happened? You used to be so vehemently against it before.
66455|0x0053B5C8|What happened? You used to be~so vehemently against it~before.
66456|0x0053B620|The situation's changed.
66457|0x0053B643|The situation's changed.
66458|0x0053B683|I feel like you're under a grave misunderstanding here. I'm not a~shinigami that reaps memories, but one that reaps nightmares.
66459|0x0053B70D|I feel like you're under a~grave misunderstanding here.~I'm not a shinigami that reaps~memories, but one that reaps
66460|0x0053B79A|Well, they're the same thing if my memories relating to the girl from~the lookout are in fact my nightmare, no?
66461|0x0053B814|Well, they're the same thing if~my memories relating to the~girl from the lookout are in~fact my nightmare, no?
66462|0x0053B8AB|Who is the girl from the lookout again?
66463|0x0053B8DD|Who is the girl from the~lookout again?
66464|0x0053B91E|My nightmare.
66465|0x0053B936|My nightmare.
66466|0x0053B96B|......
66467|0x0053B97C|......
66468|0x0053B99C|Mare, I want you to reap my nightmare.
66469|0x0053B9CD|Mare, I want you to reap my~nightmare.
66470|0x0053BA1B|...Are you sure?
66471|0x0053BA36|...Are you sure?
66472|0x0053BA60|I am.
66473|0x0053BA70|I am.
66474|0x0053BA8F|Aren't those precious memories to you?
66475|0x0053BAC0|Aren't those precious memories~to you?
66476|0x0053BB00|You're right, and they still are at this moment.
66477|0x0053BB3B|You're right, and they still~are at this moment.
66478|0x0053BB85|However, if they get in the way of me and Asuho being together, they~are an obstacle for me to overcome.
66479|0x0053BBF8|However, if they get in the way~of me and Asuho being together,~they are an obstacle for me to~overcome.
66480|0x0053BC7A|That's what I've decided.
66481|0x0053BC9E|That's what I've decided.
66482|0x0053BCDF|...Well, I see you're quite the doofus today.
66483|0x0053BD17|...Well, I see you're quite the~doofus today.
66484|0x0053BD5E|I just might be.
66485|0x0053BD79|I just might be.
66486|0x0053BDB1|And a big blockhead.
66487|0x0053BDD0|And a big blockhead.
66488|0x0053BDFE|I guess so.
66489|0x0053BE14|I guess so.
66490|0x0053BE47|You're sure you won't regret it?
66491|0x0053BE72|You're sure you won't regret~it?
66492|0x0053BEAC|Even if I do, I'll overcome that as well.
66493|0x0053BEE0|Even if I do, I'll overcome~that as well.
66494|0x0053BF24|Mare nodded.
66495|0x0053BF3B|Mare nodded.
66496|0x0053BF6F|In deference to the blockhead that you are, I'll do it before you have~time to reconsider.
66497|0x0053BFD4|In deference to the blockhead~that you are, I'll do it before~you have time to reconsider.
66498|0x0053C03E|And she meant it.
66499|0x0053C05A|And she meant it.
66500|0x0053C09F|Mare took one step's worth of distance from me, then swiped the scythe~sideways.
66501|0x0053C0FA|Mare took one step's worth of~distance from me, then swiped~the scythe sideways.
66502|0x0053C19B|It cut precisely through my chest as it passed through me.
66503|0x0053C1E0|It cut precisely through my~chest as it passed through me.
66504|0x0053C22A|It happened so quickly that I didn't even have the time to feel fear.
66505|0x0053C27A|It happened so quickly that I~didn't even have the time to~feel fear.
66506|0x0053C2CF|My nightmare was reaped.
66507|0x0053C2F2|My nightmare was reaped.
66508|0x0053C320|I forgot the girl from the lookout...
66509|0x0053C350|I forgot the girl from the~lookout...
66510|0x0053C3BB|...Hold on.
66511|0x0053C3D1|...Hold on.
66512|0x0053C425|What's wrong?
66513|0x0053C43D|What's wrong?
66514|0x0053C46A|I haven't forgotten anything.
66515|0x0053C492|I haven't forgotten anything.
66516|0x0053C4BF|If I had truly forgotten her, then the term 'girl from the lookout'~wouldn't have come to mind.
66517|0x0053C529|If I had truly forgotten her,~then the term 'girl from the~lookout' wouldn't have come to~mind.
66518|0x0053C5A2|Mare, do it for real.
66519|0x0053C5C2|Mare, do it for real.
66520|0x0053C5FF|I did.
66521|0x0053C610|I did.
66522|0x0053C630|Then don't mess it up this time.
66523|0x0053C65B|Then don't mess it up this~time.
66524|0x0053C6A3|I didn't mess it up.
66525|0x0053C6C2|I didn't mess it up.
66526|0x0053C6F0|Well, I guess your skill doesn't amount to much.
66527|0x0053C72B|Well, I guess your skill~doesn't amount to much.
66528|0x0053C783|...You're awfully cheeky for a stupid, perverted dog.
66529|0x0053C7C3|...You're awfully cheeky for a~stupid, perverted dog.
66530|0x0053C808|She was furious.
66531|0x0053C823|She was furious.
66532|0x0053C85B|I've reaped your nightmare, but you didn't forget your memories of the~girl from the lookout.
66533|0x0053C8C3|I've reaped your nightmare, but~you didn't forget your memories~of the girl from the lookout.
66534|0x0053C948|It should be obvious what happened.
66535|0x0053C976|It should be obvious what~happened.
66536|0x0053C9B3|Yeah, you failed.
66537|0x0053C9CF|Yeah, you failed.
66538|0x0053CA08|No, you idiot! It means you didn't have a nightmare.
66539|0x0053CA47|No, you idiot! It means you~didn't have a nightmare.
66540|0x0053CAA3|You didn't have one from before I reaped you. Honestly, it didn't feel~like I reaped anything to me either.
66541|0x0053CB19|You didn't have one from before~I reaped you. Honestly, it~didn't feel like I reaped~anything to me either.
66542|0x0053CB9E|Well, yeah. Because you failed.
66543|0x0053CBC8|Well, yeah. Because you failed.
66544|0x0053CC0F|...Maggy.
66545|0x0053CC23|...Maggy.
66546|0x0053CCB5|BAAW!!
66547|0x0053CCC7|BAAW!!
66548|0x0053CD17|HOT! HOT! HOT!!
66549|0x0053CD32|HOT! HOT! HOT!!
66550|0x0053CD94|Say any more stupid blockhead things like that and I'm gone.
66551|0x0053CDDB|Say any more stupid blockhead~things like that and I'm gone.
66552|0x0053CE31|...My bad. You were saying?
66553|0x0053CE57|...My bad. You were saying?
66554|0x0053CE9A|As I was saying, you don't have a nightmare.
66555|0x0053CED1|As I was saying, you don't have~a nightmare.
66556|0x0053CF25|Which means the girl from the lookout has already stopped being a~nightmare to you.
66557|0x0053CF83|Which means the girl from the~lookout has already stopped~being a nightmare to you.
66558|0x0053CFFE|I guess I should say congratulations to you, You-kun.
66559|0x0053D03E|I guess I should say~congratulations to you,~You-kun.
66560|0x0053D083|I'm sure I had a seriously dumbfounded expression on my face.
66561|0x0053D0CB|I'm sure I had a seriously~dumbfounded expression on my~face.
66562|0x0053D130|Your memories of the girl from the lookout are no longer a nightmare~to you.
66563|0x0053D187|Your memories of the girl from~the lookout are no longer a~nightmare to you.
66564|0x0053D1ED|Those memories have become something that supports you.
66565|0x0053D22F|Those memories have become~something that supports you.
66566|0x0053D28E|A part of what gives you strength.
66567|0x0053D2BB|A part of what gives you~strength.
66568|0x0053D2F7|So there's no need to worry.
66569|0x0053D31E|So there's no need to worry.
66570|0x0053D362|Your love will be all right.
66571|0x0053D389|Your love will be all right.
66572|0x0053D3CD|I'm sure it'll stay alive and well.
66573|0x0053D3FB|I'm sure it'll stay alive and~well.
66574|0x0053D42E|I was at a loss for words.
66575|0x0053D453|I was at a loss for words.
66576|0x0053D47D|As time passed, my memories of the girl from the lookout had finally~assimilated into me.
66577|0x0053D4E1|As time passed, my memories of~the girl from the lookout had~finally assimilated into me.
66578|0x0053D54A|I could go forward without relying on her.
66579|0x0053D57F|I could go forward without~relying on her.
66580|0x0053D5B9|That was probably... No, definitely, what that meant.
66581|0x0053D5F9|That was probably... No,~definitely, what that meant.
66582|0x0053D656|Goodbye, You-kun.
66583|0x0053D672|Goodbye, You-kun.
66584|0x0053D6D3|And then, after Mare disappeared...
66585|0x0053D701|And then, after Mare~disappeared...
66586|0x0053D75C|'Congratulations. You've graduated.'
66587|0x0053D78B|'Congratulations. You've~graduated.'
66588|0x0053D7BF|I felt like Mare, or perhaps the girl from the lookout, said that from~somewhere in the darkness.
66589|0x0053D82B|I felt like Mare, or perhaps~the girl from the lookout, said~that from somewhere in the~darkness.
66590|0x0053D919|Oh, you came back.
66591|0x0053D936|Oh, you came back.
66592|0x0053D9A2|But strangely enough, I can't see Asuho-san around...
66593|0x0053D9E2|But strangely enough, I can't~see Asuho-san around...
66594|0x0053DA6E|I thought you went to go see her?
66595|0x0053DA9A|I thought you went to go see~her?
66596|0x0053DAD5|...Well yeah, I did see her.
66597|0x0053DAFC|...Well yeah, I did see her.
66598|0x0053DB42|Did something happen?
66599|0x0053DB62|Did something happen?
66600|0x0053DB91|...You could say so.
66601|0x0053DBB0|...You could say so.
66602|0x0053DC0E|Guess we've got a lover's quarrel on our hands.
66603|0x0053DC48|Guess we've got a lover's~quarrel on our hands.
66604|0x0053DC91|......
66605|0x0053DCA2|......
66606|0x0053DCEF|Bull's eye, I suppose.
66607|0x0053DD10|Bull's eye, I suppose.
66608|0x0053DD50|Yes, we all know that you two are complete lovebirds. No need to~remind us.
66609|0x0053DDA6|Yes, we all know that you two~are complete lovebirds. No need~to remind us.
66610|0x0053DE01|I didn't want to hear that phrase anymore.
66611|0x0053DE36|I didn't want to hear that~phrase anymore.
66612|0x0053DE7A|I assume Asuho hasn't stopped by, right?
66613|0x0053DEAD|I assume Asuho hasn't stopped~by, right?
66614|0x0053DF1B|Nope. It sure looks like she lacks an understanding of her~responsibility as the vice president, seeing how she leaves us club~members to do all the photography.
66615|0x0053DFC7|Nope. It sure looks like she~lacks an understanding of her~responsibility as the vice~president, seeing how she
66616|0x0053E050|Well, she actually wants to be here tonight.
66617|0x0053E087|Well, she actually wants to be~here tonight.

66701|0x0053F739|She then tried to think of~other places, but ultimately~couldn't come up with any.
66702|0x0053F79B|The place where she became You's girlfriend. The place where she gave~You her virginity.
66703|0x0053F7FE|The place where she became~You's girlfriend. The place~where she gave You her~virginity.

66708|0x0053F9DC|As long as he had the lookout, a place full of memories together with~her, the rooftop couldn't be his most precious place. At the very~least, that's what Asuho thought.

66712|0x0053FB9B|She broke up with him last night.
66713|0x0053FBC7|She broke up with him last~night.
66714|0x0053FBF8|First she confessed to him, and then dumped him. Surely You would be~completely exasperated.
66715|0x0053FC5F|First she confessed to him, and~then dumped him. Surely You~would be completely~exasperated.
66716|0x0053FCCB|There was no doubt in her mind that he hated her now.
66717|0x0053FD0B|There was no doubt in her mind~that he hated her now.
66718|0x0053FD50|That thought constricted Asuho's chest and made her so depressed that~she became unable to even breath. However, since this is what she~herself wanted, she could only accept that.

66748|0x00540607|Asuho cried.
66749|0x0054061E|Asuho cried.
66750|0x0054063A|The dam holding back her tears broke.
66751|0x0054066A|The dam holding back her tears~broke.

66756|0x00540805|Even when You was searching for the girl from the lookout she still~didn't catch on.
66757|0x00540864|Even when You was searching for~the girl from the lookout she~still didn't catch on.

66774|0x00540EDD|That would surely allow You to remember her name.

66871|0x0054255E|She still kept her distance~from me.
66872|0x00542592|She was so far away from me, nowhere near the distance a couple ought~to be.
66873|0x005425E9|She was so far away from me,~nowhere near the distance a~couple ought to be.
66874|0x0054265F|I'll say it once more.

66876|0x005426A6|The voice I heard from her, so far away, felt even less intimate than~when she talked to a friend.
66877|0x00542713|The voice I heard from her, so~far away, felt even less~intimate than when she talked~to a friend.

66886|0x00542921|I just silently listened to Asuho's formal-sounding words.
66887|0x00542966|I just silently listened to~Asuho's formal-sounding words.
66888|0x005429B0|Seeing my silence, she wavered shortly, but before long she put what~she had been carrying in her hand in front of her.
66889|0x00542A32|Seeing my silence, she wavered~shortly, but before long she~put what she had been carrying~in her hand in front of her.
66890|0x00542AB9|It seemed to be an envelope.

66897|0x00542CC1|It reminds me of when she~wanted to pay me for my time.
66898|0x00542D22|It isn't money.

66900|0x00542D75|You'll find your memories inside.
66901|0x00542DA1|You'll find your memories~inside.
66902|0x00542DEC|So I'll compensate you with that.

66904|0x00542E49|She opened the envelope and took out the contents.
66905|0x00542E86|She opened the envelope and~took out the contents.
66906|0x00542F07|This is your wish card...

66909|0x00542FD1|The one you made, you know,~when we did that little~Tanabata event in class, the~day before you moved.
66910|0x00543053|I actually picked it up and took it.
66911|0x00543082|I actually picked it up and~took it.
66912|0x005430CF|I found it on the ground in the classroom. Maybe it fell down from the~bamboo tree we put them on.
66913|0x0054313C|I found it on the ground in the~classroom. Maybe it fell down~from the bamboo tree we put~them on.
66914|0x005431BA|Maybe the wind blew it off.
66915|0x005431E0|Maybe the wind blew it off.
66916|0x00543217|I don't know what happened to it, but either way, I picked it up by~chance.

66926|0x00543537|I know I should've returned it to you sooner...
66927|0x00543571|I know I should've returned it~to you sooner...
66928|0x005435BC|I should've returned it to you when you were looking for the girl from~the lookout...
66929|0x0054361C|I should've returned it to you~when you were looking for the~girl from the lookout...
66930|0x0054368D|I'm selfish, I know.

66938|0x00543806|You have it wrong.

66940|0x00543852|Hearing me interrupt her like that, Asuho could only blink in~surprise.
66941|0x005438A4|Hearing me interrupt her like~that, Asuho could only blink in~surprise.
66942|0x00543905|It wasn't an accident when I lost it, like you're thinking.
66943|0x0054394B|It wasn't an accident when I~lost it, like you're thinking.
66944|0x005439A0|I threw it away.

66946|0x005439E5|I chose not to hang it up on the bamboo tree.
66947|0x00543A1D|I chose not to hang it up on~the bamboo tree.

66952|0x00543B9C|......

66966|0x00543E05|That answer was free of any shred of hesitation, and yet...
66967|0x00543E4B|That answer was free of any~shred of hesitation, and yet...
66968|0x00543EA2|But I honestly believe I never had the right to fall in love with you.
66969|0x00543EF3|But I honestly believe I never~had the right to fall in love~with you.
66970|0x00543F55|Back as a kid, I always wanted to be your friend.
66971|0x00543F91|Back as a kid, I always wanted~to be your friend.
66972|0x00543FDE|But that's because our teacher asked me to.
66973|0x00544014|But that's because our teacher~asked me to.
66974|0x00544068|Since I was the class rep, our teacher came to me after seeing you all~by yourself all the time.
66975|0x005440D3|Since I was the class rep, our~teacher came to me after seeing~you all by yourself all the~time.
66976|0x0054414F|She asked me to try becoming your friend.
66977|0x00544183|She asked me to try becoming~your friend.
66978|0x005441C8|That was also when I learned that you didn't have a father in your~family.
66979|0x0054421D|That was also when I learned~that you didn't have a father~in your family.
66980|0x00544283|So I told her I would. It must have been because I felt a sort of~affinity towards you, since I didn't have a mother myself.
66981|0x0054430A|So I told her I would. It must~have been because I felt a sort~of affinity towards you, since~I didn't have a mother myself.
66982|0x005443A2|I thought we were birds of a feather.
66983|0x005443D2|I thought we were birds of a~feather.
66984|0x00544420|That's also why I started to call you You-chan instead, because it~seemed more friendly.
66985|0x00544483|That's also why I started to~call you You-chan instead,~because it seemed more~friendly.
66986|0x005444F7|Maybe I was lonely myself.
66987|0x0054451C|Maybe I was lonely myself.
66988|0x00544552|My dad was rarely home much due to work, and Mom had already left us~too...
66989|0x005445A8|My dad was rarely home much due~to work, and Mom had already~left us too...

66992|0x005446D8|That, I think, is what led to me falling in love with you.
66993|0x0054471D|That, I think, is what led to~me falling in love with you.
66994|0x00544773|It's a bit of a sad reason for a first love.
66995|0x005447AA|It's a bit of a sad reason for~a first love.
66996|0x005447F0|You think so?

67021|0x00544DF1|Mare appeared behind Asuho,~swinging her scythe straight~through Asuho's chest.
67022|0x00544E73|The wish card in Asuho's hands turned to dust.
67023|0x00544EAC|The wish card in Asuho's hands~turned to dust.
67024|0x00544EEA|It dispersed into tiny particles, reminding me of scales as they~fluttered about in the air.
67025|0x00544F51|It dispersed into tiny~particles, reminding me of~scales as they fluttered about~in the air.
67026|0x00544FC7|That was your nightmare.

67547|0x0054DFCD|Asuho laughed after seeing what~I was pointing at.
67548|0x0054E054|It's a self made one. Though just a simple one that consists of~sticking together a magnifying glass and reading glasses, and putting~that into some cardboard.

67556|0x0054E2CB|...I kinda wished she wouldn't though, since it gave me the urge to~reach out and touch her breasts again despite the fact that we just~had sex.

67568|0x0054E727|I found myself at a loss for words.
67569|0x0054E755|I found myself at a loss for~words.

67582|0x0054EC53|Now that I know a little more, I know that it wasn't actually a~shooting star, but a meteorite.

67590|0x0054F030|I then had an accident in the process of that.

67592|0x0054F0C1|I ran out on the road, and a car swerved around me into a guardrail.

69115|0x0056C564|...What are you trying to~imply?
69116|0x0056C5C9|The problem is that the moon is rather lustrous tonight, and observing~stars is difficult when you've got a lot of moonlight.

69152|0x0056D286|The planet itself is layered with a pale striped pattern, wherein you~can spot its famous Great Red Spot. Besides that, its four largest~moons, known as the Galilean Moons, are quite famous.

69162|0x0056D755|The brighter stars are pretty easy to see as well, even if the~moonlight is getting in the way.

69182|0x0056DE35|What's your impression in regards to the stargazing?
69183|0x0056DE74|What's your impression in~regards to the stargazing?
69184|0x0056DEC4|It was average, I guess.

69247|0x0056ECCC|Yeah, of course.
69248|0x0056ED06|I'll just tell you this now: I doubt it'll be easy to juggle both. We~have plenty of student organized events in fall, so the Student~Council won't be sitting around much at all.

69751|0x00578949|Just as I was about to leave,~Hisakaki said...
69752|0x00578993|I also have an act of generosity I need to be doing.
69753|0x005789D2|I also have an act of~generosity I need to be doing.
69754|0x00578A3C|What could that be?
69755|0x00578A5A|What could that be?
69756|0x00578A97|Not towards you though.
69757|0x00578AB9|Not towards you though.
69758|0x00578AE0|She paused for a bit, and then she went on to say...
69759|0x00578B1F|She paused for a bit, and then~she went on to say...
69760|0x00578B6F|...Could you let me talk to Mare-san tonight?
69761|0x00578BA7|...Could you let me talk to~Mare-san tonight?
69762|0x00578BE4|She looked away from me.
69763|0x00578C07|She looked away from me.
69764|0x00578C39|Sure, but why?
69765|0x00578C52|Sure, but why?
69766|0x00578C8A|...Because Kosame pulled that stunt the other night. As her older~sister, I need to apologize for her actions.
69767|0x00578D03|...Because Kosame pulled that~stunt the other night. As her~older sister, I need to~apologize for her actions.
69768|0x00578D81|She seemed embarrassed.
69769|0x00578DA3|She seemed embarrassed.
69770|0x00578DD4|You really are a good person.
69771|0x00578DFC|You really are a good person.
69772|0x00578E43|Sh-Shut up! Just answer my question! Yes or no!
69773|0x00578E7D|Sh-Shut up! Just answer my~question! Yes or no!
69774|0x00578EBC|Needless to say, the answer was clear.
69775|0x00578EED|Needless to say, the answer was~clear.
69776|0x00578F2D|You wanna come to my place after dinner then?
69777|0x00578F65|You wanna come to my place~after dinner then?
69778|0x00578FBC|...What time?
69779|0x00578FD4|...What time?
69780|0x00578FFB|Any time, as long as the stars are visible.
69781|0x00579031|Any time, as long as the stars~are visible.
69782|0x00579095|I'm sure we'll have another cloudless night tonight.

69788|0x0057923A|It was 8:00 p.m. when Hisakaki shows up.
69789|0x0057926D|It was 8:00 p.m. when Hisakaki~shows up.
69790|0x005792B1|It's already pretty late, so let's get going.
69791|0x005792E9|It's already pretty late, so~let's get going.
69792|0x00579330|Yeah.
69793|0x00579340|Yeah.
69794|0x00579355|She didn't throw in any unnecessary chatter. It was always like this~with her.
69795|0x005793AE|She didn't throw in any~unnecessary chatter. It was~always like this with her.
69796|0x00579426|Oh, that's right. Does Mare-san like sweet stuff?
69797|0x00579462|Oh, that's right. Does Mare-san~like sweet stuff?
69798|0x005794AD|...You got her a gift?
69799|0x005794CE|...You got her a gift?
69800|0x0057950E|As a token of my apology.
69801|0x00579532|As a token of my apology.
69802|0x0057955B|She's always diligent about things like that.
69803|0x00579593|She's always diligent about~things like that.
69804|0x005795DA|I don't know what Mare likes, but it's the thought that counts.
69805|0x00579624|I don't know what Mare likes,~but it's the thought that~counts.
69806|0x0057968D|It helps to hear you say that.
69807|0x005796B6|It helps to hear you say that.
69808|0x005796E4|The two of us left my house.
69809|0x0057970B|The two of us left my house.
69810|0x0057976E|Pretty cold out around this time of night, huh?
69811|0x005797A8|Pretty cold out around this~time of night, huh?
69812|0x00579819|Yep, we're already in September, after all. Besides, I think the~temperature falls quicker here in Hibarigasaki compared to　bigger~cities.
69813|0x005798AF|Yep, we're already in~September, after all. Besides,~I think the temperature falls~quicker here in Hibarigasaki
69814|0x00579938|Better make sure I get my fall clothes ready.
69815|0x00579970|Better make sure I get my fall~clothes ready.
69816|0x005799C7|Make sure you dress appropriately for the weather. I wouldn't want you~to fall sick while we have our hands full.
69817|0x00579A43|Make sure you dress~appropriately for the weather.~I wouldn't want you to fall~sick while we have our hands
69818|0x00579AC8|Yeah, I guess there's also be the prep for the Astro Club's festival~program, after all.
69819|0x00579B2B|Yeah, I guess there's also be~the prep for the Astro Club's~festival program, after all.
69820|0x00579B9F|Festival Committee work takes priority.
69821|0x00579BD1|Festival Committee work takes~priority.
69822|0x00579C12|It has about the same priority to me, though.
69823|0x00579C4A|It has about the same priority~to me, though.
69824|0x00579CA1|Still lacking self-awareness as a Student Council member, I see.
69825|0x00579CEC|Still lacking self-awareness as~a Student Council member, I~see.
69826|0x00579D3C|I sighed as I chased after Hisakaki.
69827|0x00579D6B|I sighed as I chased after~Hisakaki.
69828|0x00579E1A|I suppose there's no better time to ask this than now, but what kind~of relationship do you have with Mare-san?
69829|0x00579E94|I suppose there's no better~time to ask this than now, but~what kind of relationship do~you have with Mare-san?
69830|0x00579F1D|Just friends.
69831|0x00579F35|Just friends.
69832|0x00579F5E|Don't you think your age difference is a little odd for that?
69833|0x00579FA6|Don't you think your age~difference is a little odd for~that?
69834|0x00579FFD|I don't really think age or gender matter when it comes to friendship.
69835|0x0057A04E|I don't really think age or~gender matter when it comes to~friendship.
69836|0x0057A0BE|I can hardly agree with those statements. The latter, in particular.
69837|0x0057A10D|I can hardly agree with those~statements. The latter, in~particular.
69838|0x0057A16B|Surely you're not gonna give me that whole thing about how men and~women can't be friends, right?
69839|0x0057A1D7|Surely you're not gonna give me~that whole thing about how men~and women can't be friends,~right?
69840|0x0057A254|That's exactly what I was about to say.
69841|0x0057A286|That's exactly what I was about~to say.
69842|0x0057A2C7|Well, what, are you and I dating then?
69843|0x0057A2F8|Well, what, are you and I~dating then?
69844|0x0057A353|Of course not!
69845|0x0057A36C|Of course not!
69846|0x0057A394|Then we're just friends.
69847|0x0057A3B7|Then we're just friends.
69848|0x0057A3F9|We're not friends.
69849|0x0057A416|We're not friends.
69850|0x0057A442|...Then what are we?
69851|0x0057A461|...Then what are we?
69852|0x0057A491|Just acquaintances.
69853|0x0057A4AF|Just acquaintances.
69854|0x0057A4D2|A pretty distant relationship, if I may say so.
69855|0x0057A50C|A pretty distant relationship,~if I may say so.
69856|0x0057A565|You could also say colleagues. Or boss and subordinate.
69857|0x0057A5A7|You could also say colleagues.~Or boss and subordinate.
69858|0x0057A5F8|...Yeah. Let's stick with acquaintances.
69859|0x0057A62B|...Yeah. Let's stick with~acquaintances.
69860|0x0057A683|So where did you and Mare-san first meet each other?
69861|0x0057A6C2|So where did you and Mare-san~first meet each other?
69862|0x0057A710|At the lookout.
69863|0x0057A72A|At the lookout.
69864|0x0057A755|I already know she goes there often to look at the stars, but does~Mare-san go to the lookout all by herself?
69865|0x0057A7CD|I already know she goes there~often to look at the stars, but~does Mare-san go to the lookout~all by herself?
69866|0x0057A854|Yeah.
69867|0x0057A864|Yeah.
69868|0x0057A893|...Does she have problems at home?
69869|0x0057A8C0|...Does she have problems at~home?
69870|0x0057A8FC|According to what she says, she doesn't have a family.
69871|0x0057A93D|According to what she says, she~doesn't have a family.
69872|0x0057A99D|......
69873|0x0057A9AE|......
69874|0x0057A9CE|I've been wondering about something.
69875|0x0057A9FD|I've been wondering about~something.
69876|0x0057AA31|This was my best chance to ask her.
69877|0x0057AA5F|This was my best chance to ask~her.
69878|0x0057AAA8|Do you think Mare is a figment of the imagination?
69879|0x0057AAE5|Do you think Mare is a figment~of the imagination?
69880|0x0057AB41|......
69881|0x0057AB52|......
69882|0x0057AB72|Do you think she's not a real person, but rather just a hallucination?
69883|0x0057ABC3|Do you think she's not a real~person, but rather just a~hallucination?
69884|0x0057AC23|Or even a nightmare?
69885|0x0057AC42|Or even a nightmare?
69886|0x0057AC80|That's what Kosame said about her back then.
69887|0x0057ACB7|That's what Kosame said about~her back then.
69888|0x0057ACFD|That's why I'm asking.
69889|0x0057AD1E|That's why I'm asking.
69890|0x0057AD44|I expected her to call that idea ridiculous.
69891|0x0057AD7B|I expected her to call that~idea ridiculous.
69892|0x0057ADD1|You think of her as a normal little girl, right?
69893|0x0057AE0C|You think of her as a normal~little girl, right?
69894|0x0057AE4C|But she instead asked me that.
69895|0x0057AE75|But she instead asked me that.
69896|0x0057AEAF|You do, don't you?
69897|0x0057AECC|You do, don't you?
69898|0x0057AEF8|Right. A little shinigami girl.
69899|0x0057AF22|Right. A little shinigami girl.
69900|0x0057AF6B|With that outfit and scythe, yeah, I can definitely see why. When I~first saw her, I thought she was some girl cosplaying as a shinigami~too.
69901|0x0057B003|With that outfit and scythe,~yeah, I can definitely see why.~When I first saw her, I thought~she was some girl cosplaying as
69902|0x0057B099|Do you still?
69903|0x0057B0B1|Do you still?
69904|0x0057B0E8|If we assume Mare-san really is a hallucination, for argument's sake,~that would mean all of us who've seen her are seeing the exact same~hallucination.
69905|0x0057B18B|If we assume Mare-san really is~a hallucination, for argument's~sake, that would mean all of us~who've seen her are seeing the
69906|0x0057B223|In other words, a collective hallucination.
69907|0x0057B259|In other words, a collective~hallucination.
69908|0x0057B2AE|If she looked different to each of us, I suppose the cause would lie~with us, and the most logical suggestion would then be to go see a~doctor.
69909|0x0057B348|If she looked different to each~of us, I suppose the cause~would lie with us, and the most~logical suggestion would then
69910|0x0057B3D0|But since that wasn't the case, in fact, the cause more than likely~rested elsewhere.
69911|0x0057B430|But since that wasn't the case,~in fact, the cause more than~likely rested elsewhere.
69912|0x0057B4AF|Which brings us to the idea that the cause of the hallucination may~lie with the location, rather than with us.
69913|0x0057B529|Which brings us to the idea~that the cause of the~hallucination may lie with the~location, rather than with us.
69914|0x0057B5B2|...So the lookout?
69915|0x0057B5CF|...So the lookout?
69916|0x0057B60B|Speaking hypothetically, there could very well be some sort of~hallucinatory gas seeping out at the lookout because someone illegally~dumped shady chemicals there or whatever.
69917|0x0057B6C5|Speaking hypothetically, there~could very well be some sort of~hallucinatory gas seeping out~at the lookout because someone
69918|0x0057B75A|But the thing is, Mare shows up at other places besides the lookout.
69919|0x0057B7A9|But the thing is, Mare shows up~at other places besides the~lookout.
69920|0x0057B809|Well, there's also the possibility that the same chemicals were dumped~at the beach, and Hibari High's rooftop, too.
69921|0x0057B888|Well, there's also the~possibility that the same~chemicals were dumped at the~beach, and Hibari High's
69922|0x0057B908|Still, she showed up on a photo. How do you explain that?
69923|0x0057B94C|Still, she showed up on a~photo. How do you explain that?
69924|0x0057B9AF|Well, a certain interpretation of quantum mechanics holds that things~only have a definite existence after they're observed. If you stretch~that a bit, it fits within our assumption.
69925|0x0057BA70|Well, a certain interpretation~of quantum mechanics holds that~things only have a definite~existence after they're
69926|0x0057BAFC|Sure, but doesn't quantum mechanics only apply on the subatomic level?
69927|0x0057BB4D|Sure, but doesn't quantum~mechanics only apply on the~subatomic level?
69928|0x0057BBBD|Then just lump together the Theory of Relativity with the Quantum~Gravity Theory and there you go.
69929|0x0057BC2A|Then just lump together the~Theory of Relativity with the~Quantum Gravity Theory and~there you go.
69930|0x0057BCA6|Now you're just making things up.
69931|0x0057BCD2|Now you're just making things~up.
69932|0x0057BD1D|My point is, there are as many theories concerning what Mare-san is as~you can imagine.
69933|0x0057BD7F|My point is, there are as many~theories concerning what~Mare-san is as you can imagine.
69934|0x0057BDF2|Discussing them is nothing but a waste of time. Be she a~hallucination, or a nightmare, that doesn't matter to us.
69935|0x0057BE6F|Discussing them is nothing but~a waste of time. Be she a~hallucination, or a nightmare,~that doesn't matter to us.
69936|0x0057BF0B|After all, handing over this gift here and apologizing is far more~important.
69937|0x0057BF63|After all, handing over this~gift here and apologizing is~far more important.
69938|0x0057BFC0|Her answer lifted a load off my shoulders. One just as big as when I~learned that her hand injury had healed up.
69939|0x0057C03B|Her answer lifted a load off my~shoulders. One just as big as~when I learned that her hand~injury had healed up.
69940|0x0057C0BB|...I guess I really am just an egghead.
69941|0x0057C0ED|...I guess I really am just an~egghead.
69942|0x0057C124|The whole reason why I did all that research into memory loss and~hallucinations was also because I felt uneasy without some sort of~clear explanation.
69943|0x0057C1C6|The whole reason why I did all~that research into memory loss~and hallucinations was also~because I felt uneasy without
69944|0x0057C267|...Besides, Mare-san is your friend, right?
69945|0x0057C29D|...Besides, Mare-san is your~friend, right?
69946|0x0057C2E2|Yeah.
69947|0x0057C2F2|Yeah.
69948|0x0057C321|Hmph.
69949|0x0057C331|Hmph.
69950|0x0057C350|And so are you.
69951|0x0057C36A|And so are you.
69952|0x0057C3A3|...I told you that cheesy lines are forbidden.
69953|0x0057C3DC|...I told you that cheesy lines~are forbidden.
69954|0x0057C41A|Hisakaki sped up, and I just scratched my head as I followed after~her.
69955|0x0057C46C|Hisakaki sped up, and I just~scratched my head as I followed~after her.
69956|0x0057C519|Hisakaki stopped in her tracks before the fence.
69957|0x0057C554|Hisakaki stopped in her tracks~before the fence.
69958|0x0057C594|She peered intently through the wire mesh, not making any attempt to~enter the woods off to its side.
69959|0x0057C604|She peered intently through the~wire mesh, not making any~attempt to enter the woods off~to its side.
69960|0x0057C6A9|What's wrong?
69961|0x0057C6C1|What's wrong?
69962|0x0057C6EA|...My head hurts.
69963|0x0057C706|...My head hurts.
69964|0x0057C727|She put her hand to her forehead.
69965|0x0057C753|She put her hand to her~forehead.
69966|0x0057C78E|What's got you so exasperated now?
69967|0x0057C7BB|What's got you so exasperated~now?
69968|0x0057C807|...That's not it.
69969|0x0057C823|...That's not it.
69970|0x0057C84E|Feeling sick?
69971|0x0057C866|Feeling sick?
69972|0x0057C88F|...Seems like it.
69973|0x0057C8AB|...Seems like it.
69974|0x0057C8CC|She looked like she was in some sort of pain.
69975|0x0057C904|She looked like she was in some~sort of pain.
69976|0x0057C941|She already said she had problems with the lookout, so maybe it was~related to that.
69977|0x0057C9A0|She already said she had~problems with the lookout, so~maybe it was related to that.
69978|0x0057CA0E|...Wanna put it off for another day?

69980|0x0057CA8B|No, I'm fine.
69981|0x0057CAA3|No, I'm fine.
69982|0x0057CAC0|She lifted her head from its sunken position.

69984|0x0057CB4F|I'll go.
69985|0x0057CB62|I'll go.
69986|0x0057CB8D|Without a moment's delay, she entered the woods.
69987|0x0057CBC8|Without a moment's delay, she~entered the woods.
69988|0x0057CC08|It seems like I often end up walking behind her when we are together.
69989|0x0057CC58|It seems like I often end up~walking behind her when we are~together.
69990|0x0057CCAD|Our relationship really does seem more like boss and subordinate than~friends, now that I think about it.

69992|0x0057CDDE|Mare wasn't there.

69994|0x0057CE1D|Though I suspected she was just hiding.
69995|0x0057CE4F|Though I suspected she was just~hiding.
69996|0x0057CE86|She hadn't come to a single Astro Club meeting since the incident, but~there were several occasions where I came here and looked at the stars~with her.

71458|0x00597DDB|(Why is that?)
71459|0x00597DF4|(Why is that?)
71460|0x00597E2C|Did Kosame agree with that?
71461|0x00597E52|Did Kosame agree with that?
71462|0x00597E87|Pretty sure she did.
71463|0x00597EA6|Pretty sure she did.
71464|0x00597ED6|What methods will you be using to research it?
71465|0x00597F0F|What methods will you be using~to research it?
71466|0x00597F57|I'm not sure. They said they'd tell me about the details later.

71468|0x0059800A|......
71469|0x0059801B|......
71470|0x0059803B|Is there something that worries you about it?
71471|0x00598073|Is there something that worries~you about it?
71472|0x005980CA|...It's more bothersome than anything.
71473|0x005980FB|...It's more bothersome than~anything.
71474|0x0059813B|What's bothersome about it?
71475|0x00598161|What's bothersome about it?
71476|0x005981A6|You'll learn eventually.
71477|0x005981C9|You'll learn eventually.
71478|0x00598212|The station came into sight as we were talking.
71479|0x0059824C|The station came into sight as~we were talking.
71480|0x005982DA|Are you getting on the train, too?
71481|0x00598307|Are you getting on the train,~too?
71482|0x00598343|...Ah, crap, I didn't mean to pass by my place.
71483|0x0059837D|...Ah, crap, I didn't mean to~pass by my place.
71484|0x005983D6|Boy oh boy, what are you doing?
71485|0x00598400|Boy oh boy, what are you doing?
71486|0x0059842F|She looked at me in disbelief.
71487|0x00598458|She looked at me in disbelief.
71488|0x00598490|Hisakaki, can I have a second before you leave?
71489|0x005984CA|Hisakaki, can I have a second~before you leave?
71490|0x00598517|There was something I needed to tell her.
71491|0x0059854B|There was something I needed to~tell her.
71492|0x005985A3|You can apologize to Mare tonight.
71493|0x005985D0|You can apologize to Mare~tonight.
71494|0x0059860E|You got in touch with her?
71495|0x00598633|You got in touch with her?
71496|0x00598667|Yeah. I arranged it around the same time as last time.
71497|0x005986A8|Yeah. I arranged it around the~same time as last time.
71498|0x00598708|Thanks. I'll be at your place when the time comes then.
71499|0x0059874A|Thanks. I'll be at your place~when the time comes then.
71500|0x005987A7|Also, about the shrine maiden naginata incident at the lookout...
71501|0x005987F3|Also, about the shrine maiden~naginata incident at the~lookout...
71502|0x0059885E|...What's with that pointlessly long name?
71503|0x00598893|...What's with that pointlessly~long name?
71504|0x005988D7|Hisakaki, do you know who tried to attack Mare?
71505|0x00598911|Hisakaki, do you know who tried~to attack Mare?
71506|0x0059896A|Of course, it was Kosame. That's why I'm apologizing in the first~place.
71507|0x005989BD|Of course, it was Kosame.~That's why I'm apologizing in~the first place.
71508|0x00598A1F|Do you know who the second culprit was?
71509|0x00598A51|Do you know who the second~culprit was?
71510|0x00598A96|Hisakaki frowned.
71511|0x00598AB2|Hisakaki frowned.
71512|0x00598ADF|...There was someone else?
71513|0x00598B04|...There was someone else?
71514|0x00598B38|That's what I'm thinking. According to the victim's testimony, there~was a second suspect.
71515|0x00598B9D|That's what I'm thinking.~According to the victim's~testimony, there was a second~suspect.
71516|0x00598C13|So Mare-san told you that, basically.
71517|0x00598C43|So Mare-san told you that,~basically.
71518|0x00598C82|Yeah, and apparently that culprit was wearing a shrine maiden outfit,~just like Kosame-san.
71519|0x00598CE8|Yeah, and apparently that~culprit was wearing a shrine~maiden outfit, just like~Kosame-san.
71520|0x00598D6D|...Are you saying it was me?
71521|0x00598D94|...Are you saying it was me?
71522|0x00598DCA|No, no. Of course not.
71523|0x00598DEB|No, no. Of course not.
71524|0x00598E2B|I'm surprised you're so sure about that.
71525|0x00598E5E|I'm surprised you're so sure~about that.
71526|0x00598EA0|If you were with Kosame, you'd never have saved me.
71527|0x00598EDE|If you were with Kosame, you'd~never have saved me.
71528|0x00598F2F|Hisakaki turned away from me.
71529|0x00598F57|Hisakaki turned away from me.
71530|0x00598F9E|...Look, I didn't save you. It was all just coincidence.
71531|0x00598FE1|...Look, I didn't save you. It~was all just coincidence.
71532|0x00599029|You can't call that a coincidence. It took her two weeks to fully heal~up after that.
71533|0x00599089|You can't call that a~coincidence. It took her two~weeks to fully heal up after~that.
71534|0x005990F8|Hisakaki, I have a favor to ask of you.
71535|0x0059912A|Hisakaki, I have a favor to ask~of you.
71536|0x0059917B|...I know what you want me to do.
71537|0x005991A7|...I know what you want me to~do.
71538|0x005991E2|Really?
71539|0x005991F4|Really?
71540|0x00599225|You want me to tell you the truth if I know something, right?
71541|0x0059926D|You want me to tell you the~truth if I know something,~right?
71542|0x005992C4|That makes things quick.
71543|0x005992E7|That makes things quick.
71544|0x00599329|Well, I hate to say it, but I don't know a thing.
71545|0x00599365|Well, I hate to say it, but I~don't know a thing.
71546|0x005993A6|She shrugged her shoulders.
71547|0x005993CC|She shrugged her shoulders.
71548|0x00599401|...Kosame-san hasn't told you anything?
71549|0x00599433|...Kosame-san hasn't told you~anything?
71550|0x00599484|Just what she told you. Swore to me that she would never again attack~Mare and cause trouble.
71551|0x005994EC|Just what she told you. Swore~to me that she would never~again attack Mare and cause~trouble.
71552|0x00599565|Nothing more.
71553|0x0059957D|Nothing more.
71554|0x005995A4|...I see.
71555|0x005995B8|...I see.
71556|0x005995EB|Though if that second culprit is also after Mare, then I guess it's~only natural to link that culprit to Kosame.
71557|0x00599666|Though if that second culprit~is also after Mare, then I~guess it's only natural to link~that culprit to Kosame.
71558|0x005996F0|......
71559|0x00599701|......
71560|0x00599731|I know what you're thinking.
71561|0x00599758|I know what you're thinking.
71562|0x0059978E|Can you do that for me?
71563|0x005997B0|Can you do that for me?
71564|0x005997F1|Well, I'm closer to her than you are, after all.
71565|0x0059982C|Well, I'm closer to her than~you are, after all.
71566|0x00599876|You're a lifesaver.
71567|0x00599894|You're a lifesaver.
71568|0x005998D1|Do you want me to go about it indirectly, or directly?
71569|0x00599912|Do you want me to go about it~indirectly, or directly?
71570|0x00599962|Directly, if possible.
71571|0x00599983|Directly, if possible.
71572|0x005999C3|Guess that's one more thing you owe me for.
71573|0x005999F9|Guess that's one more thing you~owe me for.
71574|0x00599A3E|I promise I'll repay you for everything later on.
71575|0x00599A7A|I promise I'll repay you for~everything later on.
71576|0x00599AD5|I'll wait for that time to come with low expectations.
71577|0x00599B16|I'll wait for that time to come~with low expectations.
71578|0x00599B5C|Hisakaki said sullenly.
71579|0x00599B7E|Hisakaki said sullenly.
71580|0x00599BB1|Instead of inquiring about it indirectly via Kosame...
71581|0x00599BF2|Instead of inquiring about it~indirectly via Kosame...
71582|0x00599C52|I'll directly ask Setsuna-senpai herself whether she means to attack~Mare, so you just wait.
71583|0x00599CB9|I'll directly ask~Setsuna-senpai herself whether~she means to attack Mare, so~you just wait.
71584|0x00599D81|...It gets fairly cold around this time of day. Not that the previous~year was any different, but it's still rather peculiar that you need~to wear long-sleeved clothing this early.
71585|0x00599E40|...It gets fairly cold around~this time of day. Not that the~previous year was any~different, but it's still
71586|0x00599EC8|Only stands to reason. Since Hisakaki is way up north and all.
71587|0x00599F11|Only stands to reason. Since~Hisakaki is way up north and~all.
71588|0x00599FB6|I'm sorry for getting back to you so late.
71589|0x00599FEB|I'm sorry for getting back to~you so late.
71590|0x0059A05D|You'd better be. I've been calling you since this evening, and it is~only just now that you've finally decided to pick up.

71593|0x0059A1AA|True. I'm much like the wind.
71594|0x0059A1F1|...I find that a rather strange thing to say about yourself.
71595|0x0059A238|...I find that a rather strange~thing to say about yourself.
71596|0x0059A29E|I think this makes the first time you've called me.
71597|0x0059A2DC|I think this makes the first~time you've called me.
71598|0x0059A339|I guess so.
71599|0x0059A34F|I guess so.
71600|0x0059A384|So what do you want?
71601|0x0059A3A3|So what do you want?
71602|0x0059A3E1|There's something I want to ask you.
71603|0x0059A410|There's something I want to ask~you.
71604|0x0059A45E|Which would be?
71605|0x0059A478|Which would be?
71606|0x0059A4B7|I'll get straight to the point. Why are you targeting Mare-san?
71607|0x0059A501|I'll get straight to the point.~Why are you targeting Mare-san?
71608|0x0059A56A|......
71609|0x0059A57B|......
71610|0x0059A5AB|Are you going to keep silent about it like Kosame?
71611|0x0059A5E8|Are you going to keep silent~about it like Kosame?
71612|0x0059A644|...I guess it only figures you'd ask her as well.
71613|0x0059A680|...I guess it only figures~you'd ask her as well.
71614|0x0059A6CD|I did. Though I didn't get any semblance of an answer out of her.
71615|0x0059A719|I did. Though I didn't get any~semblance of an answer out of~her.
71616|0x0059A784|Simply put, the being that appears at the lookout is a nightmare to us~humans. So, it is our duty to reap it.

71618|0x0059A893|Yeah, I heard that from Kosame. That's not the kind of answer I want~from you.
71619|0x0059A8EC|Yeah, I heard that from Kosame.~That's not the kind of answer I~want from you.
71620|0x0059A956|What I'mm asking is, assuming Mare-san is a nightmare as you say, why~is it then necessary for you and Kosame to reap her?
71621|0x0059A9DB|What I'mm asking is, assuming~Mare-san is a nightmare as you~say, why is it then necessary~for you and Kosame to reap her?

71626|0x0059ABD5|I assume what you and Kosame refer to as reaping a nightmare is just~another way of referring to the process of sending back a contumacious~existence.
71627|0x0059AC76|I assume what you and Kosame~refer to as reaping a nightmare~is just another way of~referring to the process of

71630|0x0059AE10|So you've accepted it as truth?
71631|0x0059AE3A|So you've accepted it as truth?
71632|0x0059AE83|Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant. The thing that's important~is whether it puts Kosame in danger or not.
71633|0x0059AEFF|Whether I believe it or not is~irrelevant. The thing that's~important is whether it puts~Kosame in danger or not.
71634|0x0059AF9A|You seem to have the wrong picture about this. I had no part in~Kosame's involvement.
71635|0x0059AFFA|You seem to have the wrong~picture about this. I had no~part in Kosame's involvement.
71636|0x0059B079|So what, are you seriously trying to tell me she took the naginata and~went to attack Mare-san all on her own?
71637|0x0059B0F2|So what, are you seriously~trying to tell me she took the~naginata and went to attack~Mare-san all on her own?
71638|0x0059B18A|That is precisely what I'm trying to say.
71639|0x0059B1BE|That is precisely what I'm~trying to say.

71643|0x0059B2A2|It is the truth, regardless of~whether you wish to believe it~or not.
71644|0x0059B311|...Okay then.
71645|0x0059B329|...Okay then.
71646|0x0059B360|If you don't wish to expose Kosame to danger, it'd serve better to~persuade her rather than constrain me.
71647|0x0059B3D4|If you don't wish to expose~Kosame to danger, it'd serve~better to persuade her rather~than constrain me.

71653|0x0059B504|...What about you?
71654|0x0059B540|Why do you have to go after Mare-san?
71655|0x0059B570|Why do you have to go after~Mare-san?
71656|0x0059B5BF|Simply because it is my job to. However, the need to do so is now~over.
71657|0x0059B611|Simply because it is my job to.~However, the need to do so is~now over.
71658|0x0059B682|If you're worried about that thing, then I'd advise you not to be.

71668|0x0059B917|And it's for that purpose that I've come here to Hibarigasaki.
71669|0x0059B960|And it's for that purpose that~I've come here to Hibarigasaki.
71670|0x0059B9C8|Does that mean there's a contumacious existence other than Mare-san~here in Hibarigasaki?

71688|0x0059BF11|I haven't deduced whether it is or not.
71689|0x0059BF43|I haven't deduced whether it is~or not.
71690|0x0059BF94|But you can't give me an answer whenever it concerns my mother, huh?

71752|0x0059D0D1|Yeah, talk about unscientific.
71753|0x0059D0FA|Yeah, talk about unscientific.
71754|0x0059D132|Well, according to Kosame-san, when something is called unscientific,~it's just that people haven't uncovered the principle behind it.

71972|0x005A0F18|I'm not convinced...
71973|0x005A0F37|I'm not convinced...
71974|0x005A0F73|One of the things I hate the most in this world is apologizing.

71978|0x005A1081|E-Err, today's objective was ultimately getting your apology in,~right? Just let her off.
71979|0x005A10E5|E-Err, today's objective was~ultimately getting your apology~in, right? Just let her off.
71980|0x005A115C|Hisakaki still wasn't convinced, but she just nodded since she managed~to apologize, which was her original objective.

72010|0x005A1883|......
72011|0x005A1894|......
72012|0x005A18AA|Hisakaki hadn't said anything for quite some time.
72013|0x005A18E7|Hisakaki hadn't said anything~for quite some time.
72014|0x005A1958|Your face looks pale, Mokomoko.

72016|0x005A19D6|Who is this Mokomoko?!

72020|0x005A1A9C|It is. I'm completely exasperated.
72021|0x005A1AC9|It is. I'm completely~exasperated.
72022|0x005A1B05|That's not what I mean. You're feeling sick, right?

72028|0x005A1C5F|...It's nothing.
72029|0x005A1C7A|...It's nothing.
72030|0x005A1CA4|Or did you have that nightmare again last night?
72031|0x005A1CDF|Or did you have that nightmare~again last night?
72032|0x005A1D39|...I just told you it's nothing.

72040|0x005A1F5F|...Huh?
72041|0x005A1F71|...Huh?
72042|0x005A1F88|I turned to Mare.
72043|0x005A1FA4|I turned to Mare.
72044|0x005A1FFE|Mare, can you reap Hisakaki's nightmare?
72045|0x005A2031|Mare, can you reap Hisakaki's~nightmare?
72046|0x005A2081|Who's Hisakaki?
72047|0x005A209B|Who's Hisakaki?
72048|0x005A20E9|Umm, the person right here in front of you! You called her Hisakaki~Mokomoko or something just a bit ago!
72049|0x005A215D|Umm, the person right here in~front of you! You called her~Hisakaki Mokomoko or something~just a bit ago!
72050|0x005A21EE|Oh right, Hisakaki Mokomoko.
72051|0x005A2215|Oh right, Hisakaki Mokomoko.
72052|0x005A225B|I'm absolutely positive you've been getting my name wrong on purpose~this whole time!
72053|0x005A22BB|I'm absolutely positive you've~been getting my name wrong on~purpose this whole time!
72054|0x005A2341|After yelling, she crouched down and held her head. Her headache was~getting worse.
72055|0x005A239F|After yelling, she crouched~down and held her head. Her~headache was getting worse.
72056|0x005A243E|...Look, don't push yourself.
72057|0x005A2466|...Look, don't push yourself.
72058|0x005A24AD|Who's fault do you think this is...?
72059|0x005A24DC|Who's fault do you think this~is...?
72060|0x005A2543|Hisakaki tottered back to a standing position.
72061|0x005A257C|Hisakaki tottered back to a~standing position.
72062|0x005A25D4|...You aren't going to tell me that reaping my nightmare means reaping~it with that scythe there, are you?
72063|0x005A2649|...You aren't going to tell me~that reaping my nightmare means~reaping it with that scythe~there, are you?
72064|0x005A26CD|Sorry, but you're right.
72065|0x005A26F0|Sorry, but you're right.
72066|0x005A2724|I'm not a contumacious existence.
72067|0x005A2750|I'm not a contumacious~existence.
72068|0x005A2781|I heard that term once before from Mayaka-san at the summer festival.
72069|0x005A27D1|I heard that term once before~from Mayaka-san at the summer~festival.
72070|0x005A2830|I think you've gotten the wrong idea somewhere. The nightmares Mare~speaks of are memories.
72071|0x005A2896|I think you've gotten the wrong~idea somewhere. The nightmares~Mare speaks of are memories.
72072|0x005A293A|Not quite that either. When I reaped your nightmare, it just happened~to be a memory.
72073|0x005A299A|Not quite that either. When I~reaped your nightmare, it just~happened to be a memory.
72074|0x005A2A09|...Hmm, really?
72075|0x005A2A23|...Hmm, really?
72076|0x005A2A5A|That's right. After all, I'm not a memory reaping shinigami. I'm a~nightmare reaping shinigami.
72077|0x005A2AC4|That's right. After all, I'm~not a memory reaping shinigami.~I'm a nightmare reaping~shinigami.
72078|0x005A2B33|It would appear I was mistaken all this time.
72079|0x005A2B6B|It would appear I was mistaken~all this time.
72080|0x005A2BDA|...I'm not really following this conversation.
72081|0x005A2C13|...I'm not really following~this conversation.
72082|0x005A2C74|All you have to do is say the word, and I'll gladly reap your~nightmare for you.
72083|0x005A2CCF|All you have to do is say the~word, and I'll gladly reap your~nightmare for you.
72084|0x005A2D49|Don't pick up that scythe! Geez, are you trying to kill me?!
72085|0x005A2D90|Don't pick up that scythe!~Geez, are you trying to kill~me?!
72086|0x005A2DFD|After yelling, she crouched down again.
72087|0x005A2E2F|After yelling, she crouched~down again.
72088|0x005A2EA2|I told you to be careful.
72089|0x005A2EC6|I told you to be careful.
72090|0x005A2F09|It's all your fault!
72091|0x005A2F28|It's all your fault!
72092|0x005A2F6A|Fuming, she stood up.
72093|0x005A2F8A|Fuming, she stood up.
72094|0x005A2FE6|......
72095|0x005A2FF7|......
72096|0x005A300D|With her scythe still raised, Mare gazed at Hisakaki with a~questioning look on her face.
72097|0x005A3071|With her scythe still raised,~Mare gazed at Hisakaki with a~questioning look on her face.
72098|0x005A30E4|What's wrong?
72099|0x005A30FC|What's wrong?
72100|0x005A3131|...I'm getting this weird feeling of deja vu.
72101|0x005A3169|...I'm getting this weird~feeling of deja vu.
72102|0x005A31A6|While tilting her head in puzzlement, Mare asked...
72103|0x005A31E4|While tilting her head in~puzzlement, Mare asked...
72104|0x005A3265|Have you and I met before?
72105|0x005A328A|Have you and I met before?
72106|0x005A32C0|Well, the first time we met was during the beach trip.
72107|0x005A3301|Well, the first time we met was~during the beach trip.
72108|0x005A3365|I'm talking about a time much further back.

72110|0x005A33F0|...In the past?
72111|0x005A340A|...In the past?
72112|0x005A3441|Back when you were smaller.
72113|0x005A3467|Back when you were smaller.
72114|0x005A34AC|I sure don't recall it if we did.
72115|0x005A34D8|I sure don't recall it if we~did.
72116|0x005A3521|You're lying.
72117|0x005A3539|You're lying.
72118|0x005A3570|...What gives you that idea?
72119|0x005A3597|...What gives you that idea?
72120|0x005A35CD|Maybe it was Kosame-san?
72121|0x005A35F0|Maybe it was Kosame-san?
72122|0x005A3630|...Was it her younger twin sister?
72123|0x005A365D|...Was it her younger twin~sister?
72124|0x005A3699|Knowing you, I'm surprised you actually remember that.
72125|0x005A36DA|Knowing you, I'm surprised you~actually remember that.
72126|0x005A3738|I'm not stupid.
72127|0x005A3752|I'm not stupid.
72128|0x005A378B|I'm pretty sure Kosame's first time meeting her was at the beach trip~as well.
72129|0x005A37E4|I'm pretty sure Kosame's first~time meeting her was at the~beach trip as well.
72130|0x005A385A|That can't be.
72131|0x005A3873|That can't be.
72132|0x005A389F|She declared with confidence.
72133|0x005A38C7|She declared with confidence.
72134|0x005A390C|I've met one of you in the past. It was the day I reaped a nightmare~for the first time, so I could never forget it.
72135|0x005A398B|I've met one of you in the~past. It was the day I reaped a~nightmare for the first time,~so I could never forget it.

72155|0x005A3EE8|...I don't quite get it, but at~the very least, I can say that~it isn't me she's talking~about.
72156|0x005A3F6F|Maybe you're the forgetful one, Mokomoko.

72161|0x005A40D9|After yelling, she once again~crouched down.
72162|0x005A4151|...At any rate, what's of concern is Hisakaki's condition.
72163|0x005A4196|...At any rate, what's of~concern is Hisakaki's~condition.
72164|0x005A41E0|What Mare said was deeply intriguing, but I was more worried about~Hisakaki.
72165|0x005A4237|What Mare said was deeply~intriguing, but I was more~worried about Hisakaki.
72166|0x005A42AD|You can say that again... I feel like my head's about to split open...

72181|0x005A4714|Your call, Hisakaki.
72182|0x005A4752|...Look. If I got reaped by that scythe, I'd be much worse off than~just a bad injury.
72183|0x005A47B3|...Look. If I got reaped by~that scythe, I'd be much worse~off than just a bad injury.

72746|0x005AD466|I stood up while holding onto my nose.

72752|0x005AD5F6|Guessing you had it again last night?

72756|0x005AD6BF|Your face is pale.
72757|0x005AD6DC|Your face is pale.
72758|0x005AD715|......
72759|0x005AD726|......
72760|0x005AD746|Though you seem a lot better than you did the other day.
72761|0x005AD789|Though you seem a lot better~than you did the other day.
72762|0x005AD82B|*BAM*
72763|0x005AD83C|*BAM*
72764|0x005AD85C|Ugh... Do you have to be ten times more agressive than usual today?!~Like, what the hell!
72765|0x005AD8C0|Ugh... Do you have to be ten~times more agressive than usual~today?! Like, what the hell!
72766|0x005AD935|I told you not to say anything more about it and you did!
72767|0x005AD979|I told you not to say anything~more about it and you did!
72768|0x005AD9CC|...Well, I guess you must be all right if you have this much energy in~you.
72769|0x005ADA22|...Well, I guess you must be~all right if you have this much~energy in you.
72770|0x005ADA94|And whose fault do you think that is?!

72775|0x005ADB9D|*BAM*
72776|0x005ADBBF|N-N-N-No one said a single word about me getting better thanks to~you!!

72778|0x005ADC68|...Fancy that. Neither did I.
72779|0x005ADC90|...Fancy that. Neither did I.
72780|0x005ADCC7|Well, all that matters is that you're feeling better. I don't care~why.
72781|0x005ADD19|Well, all that matters is that~you're feeling better. I don't~care why.
72782|0x005ADD9E|...Hmph!
72783|0x005ADDB1|...Hmph!
72784|0x005ADDD3|Though, I was honestly thinking of asking for Mare's help if you were~still in pain today.
72785|0x005ADE38|Though, I was honestly thinking~of asking for Mare's help if~you were still in pain today.
72786|0x005ADEA2|But seeing how she was doing, it seemed fine.
72787|0x005ADEDA|But seeing how she was doing,~it seemed fine.
72788|0x005ADF2E|You mean... having her reap my nightmare?
72789|0x005ADF62|You mean... having her reap my~nightmare?
72790|0x005ADFA5|Yep.
72791|0x005ADFB4|Yep.
72792|0x005ADFD4|...It seems to me like I'll have my life reaped before any nightmare.
72793|0x005AE024|...It seems to me like I'll~have my life reaped before any~nightmare.
72794|0x005AE083|Mare's scythe only works on nightmares. You don't feel a thing, I~promise.
72795|0x005AE0D8|Mare's scythe only works on~nightmares. You don't feel a~thing, I promise.
72796|0x005AE132|Hisakaki made a confused expression.
72797|0x005AE161|Hisakaki made a confused~expression.
72798|0x005AE19F|I haven't mentioned it to you, but she reaped my nightmare once~before, actually.
72799|0x005AE1FB|I haven't mentioned it to you,~but she reaped my nightmare~once before, actually.
72800|0x005AE266|At that time, I didn't feel any ounce of pain, just one specific~memory spotlessly disappeared.
72801|0x005AE2D0|At that time, I didn't feel any~ounce of pain, just one~specific memory spotlessly~disappeared.
72802|0x005AE34B|...You've been having nightmares, too?
72803|0x005AE37C|...You've been having~nightmares, too?
72804|0x005AE3BC|Er, not really. In my case it was a memory.
72805|0x005AE3F2|Er, not really. In my case it~was a memory.
72806|0x005AE42D|The lookout girl's name.
72807|0x005AE450|The lookout girl's name.
72808|0x005AE478|I'd become unable to recall that memory that is so precious to me ever~since she reaped my nightmare.
72809|0x005AE4E8|I'd become unable to recall~that memory that is so precious~to me ever since she reaped my~nightmare.
72810|0x005AE567|After having that memory taken, there was a short time when I had a~grudge against Mare for it...
72811|0x005AE5D3|After having that memory taken,~there was a short time when I~had a grudge against Mare for~it...
72812|0x005AE64E|But well, unlike in my case, you'd be happier if that nightmare was~gone, right?
72813|0x005AE6A9|But well, unlike in my case,~you'd be happier if that~nightmare was gone, right?
72814|0x005AE720|...I definitely would rather not see it, that's for sure.
72815|0x005AE764|...I definitely would rather~not see it, that's for sure.
72816|0x005AE7B7|Want me to ask Mare?
72817|0x005AE7D6|Want me to ask Mare?
72818|0x005AE806|......
72819|0x005AE817|......
72820|0x005AE82D|I got the feeling that she didn't believe any of the things I was~saying.
72821|0x005AE881|I got the feeling that she~didn't believe any of the~things I was saying.
72822|0x005AE8DA|Even so, I expected that she would accept the effects even if she~didn't believe in my story.
72823|0x005AE942|Even so, I expected that she~would accept the effects even~if she didn't believe in my~story.
72824|0x005AE9AF|If she gave it a dubious chance, and her nightmare vanished in the~process, that would be a win.
72825|0x005AEA1A|If she gave it a dubious~chance, and her nightmare~vanished in the process, that~would be a win.
72826|0x005AEA8A|...It's just that we had to be cautious. I didn't want her to~accidentally lose some memories instead of her nightmare, like what~happened to me.
72827|0x005AEB26|...It's just that we had to be~cautious. I didn't want her to~accidentally lose some memories~instead of her nightmare, like
72828|0x005AEBB2|That was something I needed to ask Mare about.
72829|0x005AEBEB|That was something I needed to~ask Mare about.
72830|0x005AEC40|Would she really get rid of my nightmare?
72831|0x005AEC74|Would she really get rid of my~nightmare?
72832|0x005AECB7|Well, we'll have to ask Mare for the specifics.
72833|0x005AECF1|Well, we'll have to ask Mare~for the specifics.
72834|0x005AED3A|But Mare's a nightmare reaping shinigami, so yeah, she will.
72835|0x005AED81|But Mare's a nightmare reaping~shinigami, so yeah, she will.
72836|0x005AEDD9|......
72837|0x005AEDEA|......
72838|0x005AEE00|After some hesitation...
72839|0x005AEE23|After some hesitation...
72840|0x005AEE57|If that would really get rid of my nightmare, then...
72841|0x005AEE97|If that would really get rid of~my nightmare, then...
72842|0x005AEEE8|......

72844|0x005AEF26|...No, nevermind. Forget it.
72845|0x005AEF4D|...No, nevermind. Forget it.
72846|0x005AEF79|She turned away from me.
72847|0x005AEF9C|She turned away from me.
72848|0x005AEFD0|There's no reason I need to go to someone else for this...
72849|0x005AF015|There's no reason I need to go~to someone else for this...
72850|0x005AF069|Don't force yourself to just take it.

72857|0x005AF17F|I'm not.
72858|0x005AF1A1|You can rely on me, all right?
72859|0x005AF1CA|You can rely on me, all right?
72860|0x005AF204|There's no reason I would want to.
72861|0x005AF231|There's no reason I would want~to.
72862|0x005AF26D|Well, just know that if I ever spot you in pain again, I'm taking you~to Mare even if you say no.
72863|0x005AF2D9|Well, just know that if I ever~spot you in pain again, I'm~taking you to Mare even if you~say no.
72864|0x005AF356|Do that and you'll earn yourself a swift kick to the face.
72865|0x005AF39B|Do that and you'll earn~yourself a swift kick to the~face.
72866|0x005AF3EF|Before you can, I'll lift you up and take you in my ar─

72873|0x005AF59C|You already are kicking me...
72874|0x005AF5C9|I wouldn't be surprised if the bone in my nose was broken by now.
72875|0x005AF615|I wouldn't be surprised if the~bone in my nose was broken by~now.
72876|0x005AF694|Stop the chit-chat, will you? Hurry and get some water!

72882|0x005AF7E9|Exhaustion coursing through my body, I headed to the usual faucet.

72884|0x005AF8B2|Hello there, Kogasaka-san.
72885|0x005AF8D7|Hello there, Kogasaka-san.
72886|0x005AF926|When I came back to reality, Kosame-san was standing near me.
72887|0x005AF96E|When I came back to reality,~Kosame-san was standing near~me.
72888|0x005AF9C7|I heard Nee-san's clamoring voice and just couldn't help but come take~a peek.
72889|0x005AFA20|I heard Nee-san's clamoring~voice and just couldn't help~but come take a peek.
72890|0x005AFA88|...If you could put some reins on that wild horse, it would be much~appreciated.
72891|0x005AFAE3|...If you could put some reins~on that wild horse, it would be~much appreciated.
72892|0x005AFB5D|Taming her would be way too hard for me.
72893|0x005AFB90|Taming her would be way too~hard for me.
72894|0x005AFBD2|If you, of all people, can't get her under control, then I guess no~one can.
72895|0x005AFC29|If you, of all people, can't~get her under control, then I~guess no one can.
72896|0x005AFC9F|I wouldn't say that's true.

72898|0x005AFCFA|Oh right, I forgot about Mayaka-san.
72899|0x005AFD29|Oh right, I forgot about~Mayaka-san.

72902|0x005AFDC2|...If you've been watching the whole thing, then you know that I get~thrown off the saddle over and over.
72903|0x005AFE36|...If you've been watching the~whole thing, then you know that~I get thrown off the saddle~over and over.
72904|0x005AFEBB|That's only her dancing with unbridled glee.
72905|0x005AFEF2|That's only her dancing with~unbridled glee.
72906|0x005AFF38|Seemed the exact opposite to me.
72907|0x005AFF63|Seemed the exact opposite to~me.
72908|0x005AFFAD|I can tell certain things about her.
72909|0x005AFFDC|I can tell certain things about~her.
72910|0x005B001A|Because you're her twin sister?
72911|0x005B0044|Because you're her twin sister?
72912|0x005B007F|That's right.
72913|0x005B0097|That's right.
72914|0x005B00C7|Kosame-san flashed a smile, and then she walked over to Hisakaki.
72915|0x005B0113|Kosame-san flashed a smile, and~then she walked over to~Hisakaki.
72916|0x005B0164|I sighed as I turned the faucet on.

72918|0x005B0241|Here. I got you some barley tea.
72919|0x005B026C|Here. I got you some barley~tea.
72920|0x005B02A6|Thanks.
72921|0x005B02B8|Thanks.
72922|0x005B02CF|I was dropping by their house practically every day after work.
72923|0x005B0319|I was dropping by their house~practically every day after~work.
72924|0x005B0372|Yikes, this tea is hot.
72925|0x005B0394|Yikes, this tea is hot.
72926|0x005B03D5|So I would assume. It's already fall, after all. We're close to the~time of the year where the winter winds become really harsh.
72927|0x005B0460|So I would assume. It's already~fall, after all. We're close to~the time of the year where the~winter winds become really
72928|0x005B04E9|Back in the city I used to live in, the first frost was still a ways~off.
72929|0x005B053D|Back in the city I used to live~in, the first frost was still a~ways off.
72930|0x005B05CA|It's been getting cooler, so I guess it might be about time to stop~sprinkling water.
72931|0x005B062A|It's been getting cooler, so I~guess it might be about time to~stop sprinkling water.
72932|0x005B06A9|That'll reduce our chores to just sweeping.
72933|0x005B06DF|That'll reduce our chores to~just sweeping.
72934|0x005B0734|Yeah, but soon enough just sweeping up all the leaves alone will be~enough to drive us crazy.
72935|0x005B079C|Yeah, but soon enough just~sweeping up all the leaves~alone will be enough to drive~us crazy.
72936|0x005B0813|We could use those to roast sweet potatoes or something.
72937|0x005B0856|We could use those to roast~sweet potatoes or something.
72938|0x005B08B8|What a lovely idea. I might go buy some when we're further into the~fall.
72939|0x005B090C|What a lovely idea. I might go~buy some when we're further~into the fall.
72940|0x005B097F|Well, at any rate, that's a day of work done for us.
72941|0x005B09BE|Well, at any rate, that's a day~of work done for us.
72942|0x005B0A25|The three of us sipped on the hot barley tea.

72945|0x005B0B20|Oh, come to think of it, I've~got something to notify you of,~Hisakaki.
72946|0x005B0B91|What's that?

73185|0x005B50A4|Do you hate the stars on~average?

73564|0x005BC9EC|It was during broad daylight, too, so everyone just suddenly spotted~this long, thin cloud in the sky. Not even a moment later, a~thunderous roar was echoing through the town.

73576|0x005BD035|Anyway, following the researchers' notification, word spread around~town about the meteor that had fallen somewhere on Hibari Mountain.
73577|0x005BD0C7|Anyway, following the~researchers' notification, word~spread around town about the~meteor that had fallen
73578|0x005BD15A|That led to the townspeople forming a voluntary search party.

73580|0x005BD1FB|Apparently the whole town got crazy worked up over it, like a festival~was going on or something. So then they all went into the mountain~area, and searched every last inch of the pathless woods and valleys.

73584|0x005BD3EE|That also just happened to be the year of Hibari High's opening.
73585|0x005BD439|That also just happened to be~the year of Hibari High's~opening.

73591|0x005BD695|I'm surprised you found that~out.
73592|0x005BD6E0|Well, it's simply because this year is Hibari High's fifty-fifth year~since its foundation.

73610|0x005BE141|Ah... Then does that mean the reason the school had an astronomy club~since its inception was because of this?
73611|0x005BE1BA|Ah... Then does that mean the~reason the school had an~astronomy club since its~inception was because of this?
73612|0x005BE252|Sure is. I'd say the search party's efforts sure did a number to~increase the public hype about astronomy back then.

73673|0x005BF953|As Hisakaki's indignation~settled down, the lecture about~meteorites resumed.
73674|0x005BF9EC|Through the observatory, the meteorite was immediately sent to a~research institution down in some big city. In order to examine~whether it truly was a meteorite, that is.

73677|0x005BFBB6|After that, they proved that it~was, in fact real, and it then~got the name The Hibarigasaki~Meteorite.
73678|0x005BFC39|It seems like the proper naming procedure for meteorites is to call~them by the place where they came down. After that, since the~townspeople also requested it, the meteorite was immediately returned~to Hibarigasaki.

73688|0x005C0051|Was there some sort of secret surrounding it?

73693|0x005C0191|Yeah, Seitengu.
73694|0x005C01BC|Correct. Just like the name implies, we worship the stars. More~specifically, we revere the deity called the August Star of Heaven.

73697|0x005C0304|What is the August Star of~Heaven?
73698|0x005C0376|Definitely sounds like something you'd find in Japanese mythology.
73699|0x005C03C3|Definitely sounds like~something you'd find in~Japanese mythology.
73700|0x005C042F|You're be right about that. It's a deity that has its roots in~Japanese mythology.

73705|0x005C05CC|...What exactly is that?
73706|0x005C05F4|I'd heard that term several times before.
73707|0x005C0628|I'd heard that term several~times before.
73708|0x005C067B|You don't mean a continuous existence, like a god that lives forever?

74184|0x005CAA06|She falls, and upon reaching the bottom, is met with death.

74200|0x005CAE88|So very cold that she feels she will freeze.
74201|0x005CAEBF|So very cold that she feels she~will freeze.
74202|0x005CAEFB|So she could only lay there, motionless.

74210|0x005CB080|Her nightmare had always, up until this point, ended upon her hitting~ground.
74211|0x005CB0D8|Her nightmare had always, up~until this point, ended upon~her hitting ground.

74220|0x005CB315|She carefully searched through her memory.
74221|0x005CB34A|She carefully searched through~her memory.
74222|0x005CB3A1|Amidst the crimson hue of the sunset, there were only green and black~for other colors.
74223|0x005CB403|Amidst the crimson hue of the~sunset, there were only green~and black for other colors.
74224|0x005CB46A|The green was vegetation, and the black was the sky or possibly the~ground.
74225|0x005CB4C0|The green was vegetation, and~the black was the sky or~possibly the ground.
74226|0x005CB51B|If the red stems from the setting sun, then that means the red is the~sky.

74228|0x005CB5CA|Which then led her to the conclusion that the black must be the~ground.
74229|0x005CB61C|Which then led her to the~conclusion that the black must~be the ground.
74230|0x005CB673|A ground, with lots of vegetation surrounding it.

74448|0x005CF53A|A moment of silence.
74449|0x005CF559|A moment of silence.

74462|0x005CF80B|She was visibly nervous, with her gaze wandering up and down.
74463|0x005CF853|She was visibly nervous, with~her gaze wandering up and down.

74488|0x005CFD38|Of course there's not poison in it, you doofus!

74496|0x005CFF1D|...That's what I'm trying to tell you.
74497|0x005CFF4E|...That's what I'm trying to~tell you.
74498|0x005CFF84|It was even more inexplicable to me now.
74499|0x005CFFB7|It was even more inexplicable~to me now.
74500|0x005CFFFB|...Look, there's no deeper meaning behind it or anything.
74501|0x005D003F|...Look, there's no deeper~meaning behind it or anything.
74502|0x005D0088|She hugged her knees and rested her chin on them.
74503|0x005D00C4|She hugged her knees and rested~her chin on them.
74504|0x005D011C|I made too much. That's all.
74505|0x005D0143|I made too much. That's all.
74506|0x005D017B|It would be a waste to throw it away, so you eat it.

74508|0x005D01FE|She turned away from me with a hmph.
74509|0x005D022D|She turned away from me with a~hmph.

74518|0x005D0532|The school cafeteria has a lot of different options, but in exchange~you don't get much day-to-day variation. Anyone would get tired of it~eventually.

74704|0x005D3140|That theory exists as well, yeah. Other than that, they also say~things like it's to organize all the events that have happened~throughout the day, fulfillment of subconscious wishes, and so on.

74712|0x005D345F|It isn't just the sunset inside my dream. I also feel like I see~vegetation.
74713|0x005D34B6|It isn't just the sunset inside~my dream. I also feel like I~see vegetation.
74714|0x005D351E|The place I fall towards is one that has a lot of vegetation.

74716|0x005D35BF|I fall, and then I die.

74720|0x005D3732|I've met one of you in the past. It was the day I reaped a nightmare~for the first time, so I could never forget it.

74722|0x005D384D|I reaped the nightmare of either you or your sister when you were~kids.
74723|0x005D389F|I reaped the nightmare of~either you or your sister when~you were kids.
74724|0x005D3944|That got me thinking, like maybe...
74725|0x005D3972|That got me thinking, like~maybe...
74726|0x005D39B1|Maybe I had been to the lookout once before...
74727|0x005D39EA|Maybe I had been to the lookout~once before...
74728|0x005D3A28|I was completely speechless.
74729|0x005D3A4F|I was completely speechless.
74730|0x005D3A86|By contrast, Hisakaki looked like a weight had been taken off her~shoulders.

74732|0x005D3B45|Well, that's the kind of interesting hypothesis you can make.

74734|0x005D3BE4|...Hisakaki.

74736|0x005D3C23|I feel a lot better now that I've gotten that off my chest.

74738|0x005D3CC0|Maybe Kosame was right. Maybe it really was a good thing I told you.

74744|0x005D3EE9|What's wrong with it?
74745|0x005D3F09|What's wrong with it?
74746|0x005D3F38|Everything! I mean, there's only one thing you can infer from that...

74748|0x005D3FDD|Mare frequently appeared at the lookout. So, assuming Hisakaki and~Mare really did meet in the past, it would have to have been there.

74751|0x005D4173|Couple that with the fact that~Hisakaki's dream involved her~falling at some place with a~large number of trees.
74752|0x005D41F3|So if we accept the hypothesis that dreaming is a way of~re-experiencing past events, and also assume that Hisakaki had been to~the lookout as a kid, that only leads to one conclusion.
74753|0x005D42B6|So if we accept the hypothesis~that dreaming is a way of~re-experiencing past events,~and also assume that Hisakaki
74754|0x005D4345|I've died once before?
74755|0x005D4366|I've died once before?
74756|0x005D4396|...That would raise questions about who the Hisakaki in front of me~is, so that can't be right.

74758|0x005D4479|But you don't feel too comfortable about the lookout, right?
74759|0x005D44C0|But you don't feel too~comfortable about the lookout,~right?
74760|0x005D4523|...What's your point? To begin with, you have to remember that I have~no recollection of having been to the lookout in the past.

74768|0x005D487B|If that theory was right, then that would definitely answer the~question as to why the lookout was off-limits.

74770|0x005D497C|Why are you so bad with the lookout?

74772|0x005D49EB|...Don't expect me to know that.
74773|0x005D4A16|...Don't expect me to know~that.
74774|0x005D4A50|That means you're unconsciously bad with it.

74776|0x005D4ACF|Are you trying to say this past accident I've forgotten is the reason?

74778|0x005D4B80|Are you going to tell me it sounds like utter nonsense?
74779|0x005D4BC2|Are you going to tell me it~sounds like utter nonsense?
74780|0x005D4C20|...Not at all. It's far more realistic than all that jargon like~shinigami and Astral Spirits.
