36332|0x0031B181|Nee-san, if you could go home and take care of Mom, that would be~great. It will impair tomorrow's clean up if she goes too hard on the~liquor.

36345|0x0031B6A1|So how was it?
36346|0x0031B6D9|...It left me exhausted.
36347|0x0031B6FC|...It left me exhausted.
36348|0x0031B724|At least she didn't say that it was boring.

36355|0x0031B8BE|Taking her yawning little~sister with her, Aoi-san headed~into their house.
36356|0x0031B919|She apparently contacted their parents beforehand. When the door~opened, I saw the two welcoming them home.

36380|0x0031C1A4|...You can get to the lookout by car?

36382|0x0031C223|As long as it's just an auto, you can drive to at least the fence. I'd~have no trouble coming there to get you.

36384|0x0031C326|No, that's all right. I'll walk home.
36385|0x0031C356|No, that's all right. I'll walk~home.
36386|0x0031C3A5|Don't be like that. You're with two of your friends, right? And girls~at that.

36392|0x0031C51E|I wasn't too sure what she was getting at.
36393|0x0031C553|I wasn't too sure what she was~getting at.
36394|0x0031C5A7|I'll drive your friends home too. It'll be safer that way. So, does~that sound all right?
36395|0x0031C60B|I'll drive your friends home~too. It'll be safer that way.~So, does that sound all right?
36396|0x0031C674|Although with Asuho and Kosame-san, you could probably call them~flowers.
36397|0x0031C6C8|Although with Asuho and~Kosame-san, you could probably~call them flowers.
36398|0x0031C72B|Yeah, thanks.
36399|0x0031C743|Yeah, thanks.
36400|0x0031C76C|No problem. Oh, and I'm kind of curious, You-chan.
36401|0x0031C7A9|No problem. Oh, and I'm kind of~curious, You-chan.
36402|0x0031C7F5|Hmm?
36403|0x0031C804|Hmm?
36404|0x0031C832|Which one is your girlfriend?
36405|0x0031C85A|Which one is your girlfriend?
36406|0x0031C891|...Um, both of them are just friends.
36407|0x0031C8C1|...Um, both of them are just~friends.
36408|0x0031C8F6|Unexpected as it was, Shino-san actually rather enjoyed this kind of~talk.
36409|0x0031C94B|Unexpected as it was, Shino-san~actually rather enjoyed this~kind of talk.
36410|0x0031C9DF|Thereafter, the three of us trekked up the hill road.
36411|0x0031CA1F|Thereafter, the three of us~trekked up the hill road.
36412|0x0031CA64|Asuho to my right, and Kosame-san to my left.
36413|0x0031CA9C|Asuho to my right, and~Kosame-san to my left.
36414|0x0031CAD9|Would one count me lucky to be surrounded by women, even if they're~just friends?
36415|0x0031CB35|Would one count me lucky to be~surrounded by women, even if~they're just friends?
36416|0x0031CBC9|I was positive you'd turn down the offer to go to the lookout,~Kosame-san.
36417|0x0031CC1E|I was positive you'd turn down~the offer to go to the lookout,~Kosame-san.
36418|0x0031CC84|Why did you think that?
36419|0x0031CCA6|Why did you think that?
36420|0x0031CCD7|Well, last time you seemed to be against it. You said it was dangerous~and stuff.
36421|0x0031CD33|Well, last time you seemed to~be against it. You said it was~dangerous and stuff.
36422|0x0031CDC6|Yeah, I remember that. I also figured chances were pretty grim you'd~say yes.
36423|0x0031CE1E|Yeah, I remember that. I also~figured chances were pretty~grim you'd say yes.
36424|0x0031CE95|But it isn't dangerous, right?
36425|0x0031CEBE|But it isn't dangerous, right?
36426|0x0031CF06|Safe as can be! The footing is also solid and all.
36427|0x0031CF43|Safe as can be! The footing is~also solid and all.
36428|0x0031CF9F|That means it was just a needless fear on my end. There is no reason~for me not to participate.
36429|0x0031D009|That means it was just a~needless fear on my end. There~is no reason for me not to~participate.
36430|0x0031D086|Both Asuho and I were puzzled by Kosame-san's sudden change of heart.
36431|0x0031D0D6|Both Asuho and I were puzzled~by Kosame-san's sudden change~of heart.
36432|0x0031D162|Soon after, we reached the lookout.
36433|0x0031D190|Soon after, we reached the~lookout.
36434|0x0031D1C3|I put down the telescope and took a moment to catch my breath.
36435|0x0031D20C|I put down the telescope and~took a moment to catch my~breath.
36436|0x0031D277|According to Asuho, Orihime and Hikoboshi shine brightest on the 7th~of August.
36437|0x0031D2D1|According to Asuho, Orihime and~Hikoboshi shine brightest on~the 7th of August.
36438|0x0031D330|A simple gaze up at the night sky led me to believe that was correct,~as my vision was filled with brightly shining lights.
36439|0x0031D3B6|A simple gaze up at the night~sky led me to believe that was~correct, as my vision was~filled with brightly shining
36440|0x0031D445|The stars seem so very close...
36441|0x0031D46F|The stars seem so very close...
36442|0x0031D4E7|Kosame-san, who was here for the first time, gasped in admiration.
36443|0x0031D534|Kosame-san, who was here for~the first time, gasped in~admiration.
36444|0x0031D5B8|Kosame-chan, use this. Check out the stars with these binoculars while~I get the telescope ready.
36445|0x0031D624|Kosame-chan, use this. Check~out the stars with these~binoculars while I get the~telescope ready.
36446|0x0031D6B9|After passing Kosame-san the binoculars, Asuho took her telescope out~of the carrying case and started to set it up.
36447|0x0031D738|After passing Kosame-san the~binoculars, Asuho took her~telescope out of the carrying~case and started to set it up.
36448|0x0031D7BC|It was basically routine for me to go looking for Mare in the mean~time.
36449|0x0031D80F|It was basically routine for me~to go looking for Mare in the~mean time.
36450|0x0031D867|Leaving Asuho and Kosame-san there, I started walking around.
36451|0x0031D8AF|Leaving Asuho and Kosame-san~there, I started walking~around.
36452|0x0031D939|Kogasaka-san.
36453|0x0031D951|Kogasaka-san.
36454|0x0031D9A0|Kosame-san came over after I walked halfway around the lookout.
36455|0x0031D9EA|Kosame-san came over after I~walked halfway around the~lookout.
36456|0x0031DA53|Are you looking for Mare-san?
36457|0x0031DA7B|Are you looking for Mare-san?
36458|0x0031DAB2|Yeah. What about you?
36459|0x0031DAD2|Yeah. What about you?
36460|0x0031DB11|I figured I would accompany you.
36461|0x0031DB3C|I figured I would accompany~you.
36462|0x0031DB6C|Saying so, she walked over next to me.
36463|0x0031DB9D|Saying so, she walked over next~to me.
36464|0x0031DBDD|You're already done looking at the stars?
36465|0x0031DC11|You're already done looking at~the stars?
36466|0x0031DC64|Yes. Both Orihime and Hikoboshi are shining very beautifully. I'm sure~they're both rejoicing in their reunion.
36467|0x0031DCDE|Yes. Both Orihime and Hikoboshi~are shining very beautifully.~I'm sure they're both rejoicing~in their reunion.
36468|0x0031DD67|What's Asuho up to?
36469|0x0031DD85|What's Asuho up to?
36470|0x0031DDC2|She was in the middle of setting up the telescope, but when I returned~the binoculars to her, she became so absorbed in looking at the stars~that my words didn't even enter here ears anymore.
36471|0x0031DE8C|She was in the middle of~setting up the telescope, but~when I returned the binoculars~to her, she became so absorbed
36472|0x0031DF1A|Sounds just like her.
36473|0x0031DF3A|Sounds just like her.
36474|0x0031DF79|True.
36475|0x0031DF89|True.
36476|0x0031DFA8|Let's go back as soon as we find Mare.
36477|0x0031DFD9|Let's go back as soon as we~find Mare.
36478|0x0031E029|All right.
36479|0x0031E03E|All right.
36480|0x0031E058|Next, we searched the remaining half of the lookout.
36481|0x0031E097|Next, we searched the remaining~half of the lookout.
36482|0x0031E0DB|I expected to find her easily with two pairs of eyes.
36483|0x0031E11B|I expected to find her easily~with two pairs of eyes.
36484|0x0031E16A|If Hisakaki were here, I could have her help us search, too.
36485|0x0031E1B1|If Hisakaki were here, I could~have her help us search, too.
36486|0x0031E21D|Of course, Nee-san would likely refuse to.
36487|0x0031E252|Of course, Nee-san would likely~refuse to.
36488|0x0031E28C|Hisakaki wouldn't come to see the stars in the first place.
36489|0x0031E2D2|Hisakaki wouldn't come to see~the stars in the first place.
36490|0x0031E31D|The reason that she didn't come along today was probably that she was~tired, but I bet she wouldn't have come regardless.
36491|0x0031E3A1|The reason that she didn't come~along today was probably that~she was tired, but I bet she~wouldn't have come regardless.
36492|0x0031E444|Kogasaka-san...
36493|0x0031E45E|Kogasaka-san...
36494|0x0031E47D|Kosame-san lowered her voice.
36495|0x0031E4A5|Kosame-san lowered her voice.
36496|0x0031E4F2|Do you believe in spiritual senses?
36497|0x0031E520|Do you believe in spiritual~senses?
36498|0x0031E55D|...Where is this coming from?
36499|0x0031E585|...Where is this coming from?
36500|0x0031E5BE|You could also phrase it as spiritual powers or supernatural powers~instead. Well, do you believe in those?
36501|0x0031E634|You could also phrase it as~spiritual powers or~supernatural powers instead.~Well, do you believe in those?
36502|0x0031E6B9|Well, you're a shrine maiden, after all.
36503|0x0031E6EC|Well, you're a shrine maiden,~after all.
36504|0x0031E724|It wouldn't be all that strange for her to possess that kind of power.
36505|0x0031E775|It wouldn't be all that strange~for her to possess that kind of~power.
36506|0x0031E7E5|Do you believe they exist?
36507|0x0031E80A|Do you believe they exist?
36508|0x0031E834|Kosame-san insistently repeated the question.
36509|0x0031E86C|Kosame-san insistently repeated~the question.
36510|0x0031E8A9|Her eyes seemed to pierce straight into me.
36511|0x0031E8DF|Her eyes seemed to pierce~straight into me.
36512|0x0031E934|Powers that make you see something others can't.
36513|0x0031E96F|Powers that make you see~something others can't.
36514|0x0031E9BB|Powers that make you sense things others can't.
36515|0x0031E9F5|Powers that make you sense~things others can't.
36516|0x0031EA40|The product of these may not only be deities and spirits, but also~shinigami.
36517|0x0031EA98|The product of these may not~only be deities and spirits,~but also shinigami.
36518|0x0031EB0F|Would you say you believe in the existence of such powers?
36519|0x0031EB54|Would you say you believe in~the existence of such powers?
36520|0x0031EB9E|I replied with a wry smile on my face.
36521|0x0031EBCF|I replied with a wry smile on~my face.
36522|0x0031EC0F|A year or two ago I would've said I don't, but now, honestly, I just~might.
36523|0x0031EC65|A year or two ago I would've~said I don't, but now,~honestly, I just might.
36524|0x0031ECCA|I've gone through several mysterious experiences by now.
36525|0x0031ED0D|I've gone through several~mysterious experiences by now.
36526|0x0031ED55|I suspected Mare of being a hallucination, and did research into~memory loss until just recently, but those feelings had disappeared by~this point.
36527|0x0031EDF3|I suspected Mare of being a~hallucination, and did research~into memory loss until just~recently, but those feelings
36528|0x0031EE77|Kosame-san removed her gaze from me, looking straight ahead instead.
36529|0x0031EEC6|Kosame-san removed her gaze~from me, looking straight ahead~instead.
36530|0x0031EF34|That just might be the reason why Nee-san hates this place so much...
36531|0x0031EF84|That just might be the reason~why Nee-san hates this place so~much...
36532|0x0031EFE5|Her hatred may be the result of her feeling something from this~lookout that we do not.
36533|0x0031F047|Her hatred may be the result of~her feeling something from this~lookout that we do not.
36534|0x0031F0C8|So maybe it isn't be correct to say that the stars are what she hates,~but rather only this place.

36803|0x0032349D|I suppose your choice of words~was inadequate. You asked her,~'I can consider you a~shinigami, right?' That sounds
36804|0x00323539|Mare-san wants you to sincerely, from the bottom of your heart,~believe that she is a shinigami.
36805|0x003235A4|Mare-san wants you to~sincerely, from the bottom of~your heart, believe that she is~a shinigami.
36806|0x00323614|That didn't really click in my head.
36807|0x00323643|That didn't really click in my~head.
36808|0x00323691|Let's suppose, for example, you were in a relationship with Asuho-san.~If you then confirmed that with her by saying 'I can consider you my~girlfriend, right?...'
36809|0x0032373E|Let's suppose, for example, you~were in a relationship with~Asuho-san. If you then~confirmed that with her by
36810|0x003237D5|I imagine that would really depress Asuho-san.
36811|0x0032380E|I imagine that would really~depress Asuho-san.
36812|0x00323856|...Don't use such a weird example.
36813|0x00323883|...Don't use such a weird~example.
36814|0x003238CF|It still doesn't make sense?
36815|0x003238F6|It still doesn't make sense?
36816|0x00323922|I got closer to imagining that scenario, but then I just shook it off.
36817|0x00323973|I got closer to imagining that~scenario, but then I just shook~it off.
36818|0x003239D3|...Well, who cares about that.
36819|0x003239FC|...Well, who cares about that.
36820|0x00323A2A|Did Mare think that I was deceiving her?
36821|0x00323A5D|Did Mare think that I was~deceiving her?
36822|0x00323A9F|Kosame-san, do you feel anything in regards to Mare?
36823|0x00323ADE|Kosame-san, do you feel~anything in regards to Mare?
36824|0x00323B3C|...In what sense?
36825|0x00323B58|...In what sense?
36826|0x00323B83|Well, if Hisakaki has a sense for the spiritual, I figured you might~be sensitive to the spiritual as well.
36827|0x00323BF9|Well, if Hisakaki has a sense~for the spiritual, I figured~you might be sensitive to the~spiritual as well.
36828|0x00323C7E|Isn't that why you asked her those questions?
36829|0x00323CB6|Isn't that why you asked her~those questions?
36830|0x00323D0D|...No.
36831|0x00323D1E|...No.
36832|0x00323D34|Kosame-san denied it.
36833|0x00323D54|Kosame-san denied it.
36834|0x00323D93|I heard from you all that Mare-san was quite the mysterious one, so it~was just genuine curiosity.
36835|0x00323E00|I heard from you all that~Mare-san was quite the~mysterious one, so it was just~genuine curiosity.
36836|0x00323E7C|Really?
36837|0x00323E8E|Really?
36838|0x00323EBF|Why do you doubt it?
36839|0x00323EDE|Why do you doubt it?
36840|0x00323F0C|Because you always go on about how you hate prying, and yet did it~yourself. It's only natural to think you must have had some reason for~it then, right?
36841|0x00323FB0|Because you always go on about~how you hate prying, and yet~did it yourself. It's only~natural to think you must have

36846|0x003240F9|Yes.
36847|0x00324108|Yes.
36848|0x0032411C|Kosame-san smiled softly.
36849|0x00324140|Kosame-san smiled softly.
36850|0x00324183|It's not polite to pry, plain and simple. If you want to pry anyway,~you should hold off until you grow closer to that person.

36876|0x0032470A|Kosame-san chopped me on the head.
36877|0x00324737|Kosame-san chopped me on the~head.

36879|0x003247F1|Even if that's something you~think, you mustn't say it out~loud.

36883|0x00324983|You mean, sort of like jinxing~things?
36884|0x003249D3|Exactly.
36885|0x003249E6|Exactly.
36886|0x003249FE|I guess it is fitting for a shrine maiden to believe that.
36887|0x00324A43|I guess it is fitting for a~shrine maiden to believe that.
36888|0x00324AA7|If, by any chance, that became true... it would become a very~precarious situation.

37156|0x00328F2B|I was prepared for a scolding from Shino-san for letting her go home~alone, but apparently Kosame-san somehow explained it to her in a way~that convinced Shino-san it wasn't my fault.

37672|0x00332BB9|Luckily, we also have a new moon tonight, which means no moonlight to~obstruct our view, and being on a rooftop, we can see from horizon to~horizon. These conditions might be the best we could've hoped for.

37684|0x003331AC|It's only around one second after appearing that a shooting star~disappears, so I think it's difficult to actually make a wish.

38022|0x00339D2E|Okay.
38023|0x00339D3E|Okay.
38024|0x00339D6D|But that doesn't mean I like it, all right?
38025|0x00339DA3|But that doesn't mean I like~it, all right?
38026|0x00339DF8|I know.
38027|0x00339E0A|I know.
38028|0x00339E5C|Mayaka left the living room.
38029|0x00339E83|Mayaka left the living room.
38030|0x00339EAF|She probably went outside to gaze up at the night sky just like she~said she would.
38031|0x00339F0D|She probably went outside to~gaze up at the night sky just~like she said she would.
38032|0x00339F70|The shrine is fairly secluded from any residential places, so there's~nothing to get in the way of stargazing.

38034|0x0033A0A9|...What's so fun about looking up at the sky?

38036|0x0033A159|Her mood now rotten, Komomo threw herself down on a floor cushion.

38038|0x0033A1F8|The hem of her skirt flipped up, putting her underwear on display, but~with no one but her around, she just didn't care.

38041|0x0033A340|(Why do I hate the stars so~much?)
38042|0x0033A372|To her, the idea of stargazing on the rooftop was unthinkable, and~stargazing at the lookout even more so.

38044|0x0033A461|But why?
38045|0x0033A474|But why?
38046|0x0033A48C|She couldn't find an answer to that question.
38047|0x0033A4C4|She couldn't find an answer to~that question.
38048|0x0033A501|Since she didn't understand her own feelings, there was no way to~answer it.
38049|0x0033A558|Since she didn't understand her~own feelings, there was no way~to answer it.
38050|0x0033A5B4|So, even when pressed about her disdain, she couldn't muster up any~semblance of an answer.

38052|0x0033A685|She couldn't explain her reasoning to Kosame or You.

38054|0x0033A708|If she had to give a reason for her hate of the stars nonetheless, a~simple instinctive aversion would be the most fitting.

38062|0x0033A93C|Sweet potatoes were fine, and she could enjoy pumpkin when used in~soups or sweets, but when it came to stewed pumpkin or tempura~pumpkin, she could hardly swallow it.
38063|0x0033A9EE|Sweet potatoes were fine, and~she could enjoy pumpkin when~used in soups or sweets, but~when it came to stewed pumpkin
38064|0x0033AA74|There is no logical reason behind it. She simply can't stand pumpkin,~and that's that.

38070|0x0033AC83|Yes, no matter how much Kosame deplored it, and no matter how much~Asuho begrudged her for it...

38136|0x0033C412|Yeah, because the radiant moves to a higher altitude in firmament past~midnight, thus making it easier to see shooting stars. Though our~permission to use the rooftop only goes until 11:00 p.m.

38178|0x0033D036|Like she was really forcing herself to appear older than she is.
38179|0x0033D081|Like she was really forcing~herself to appear older than~she is.
38180|0x0033D0D1|The girl from the lookout used to do that as well.

38182|0x0033D1A7|Regardless of how Mare-kun feels about it, I'm sure she definitely~doesn't regret coming.

38184|0x0033D274|Exactly.

38206|0x0033D8AE|Don't say that so suggestively!

38272|0x0033ECF3|...You can say that again.
38273|0x0033ED18|...You can say that again.
38274|0x0033ED77|I think Suzuha-chan's still asleep, so I'll give her a piggyback ride~to your house.

38304|0x0033F847|The cemetery on the outskirts of town was likely full of people, but~that had nothing to do with Hisakaki Komomo, who spent her days in a~laid back fashion, as she did during every year's Bon Festival.

38352|0x00340B70|As for why she suddenly got the urge to do so, it was partly due to~her newfound boredom with the Bon Festival, which was now under way,~and also likely due to her conversation with Mayaka the other day.

39810|0x0035BE7F|No worries, not like I have anything else to do anyway. We hardly get~any customers coming in during the Bon Festival.
39811|0x0035BF00|No worries, not like I have~anything else to do anyway. We~hardly get any customers coming~in during the Bon Festival.

39827|0x0035C4D0|Aoi-san's message was short and~to the point, while Suzuha-chan~wrote enough to fill the~cellphone's screen twice over.
39828|0x0035C557|The content between the two of them also contrasted, but their worry~for Chinami was mutual. You'd have to do some serious mental~gymnastics to decipher Aoi-san's message in a way that gives you that~conclusion though.

40470|0x00367973|How did the culprit know that Mare was at the lookout?
40471|0x003679B4|How did the culprit know that~Mare was at the lookout?
40472|0x003679FA|And how did the culprit know about Mare being a shinigami?
40473|0x00367A3F|And how did the culprit know~about Mare being a shinigami?
40474|0x00367A89|As for the first one, it was very possible that only Setsuna-senpai~herself knew that.
40475|0x00367AEA|As for the first one, it was~very possible that only~Setsuna-senpai herself knew~that.
40476|0x00367B50|But the latter two points were things that Setsuna-senpai couldn't~have known.
40477|0x00367BA9|But the latter two points were~things that Setsuna-senpai~couldn't have known.

40488|0x00367F51|You look tired.

41178|0x0037395D|I got a message a little earlier. There's apparently something the~culprit wants to talk about, and this is the place she summoned me to.

41181|0x00373A8B|......
41182|0x00373AAB|So you have to promise me you won't come out.
41183|0x00373AE3|So you have to promise me you~won't come out.
41184|0x00373B20|The culprit's objective could be larger than what she said.

41196|0x00373DF0|Why?!
41197|0x00373E00|Why?!
41198|0x00373E1F|If the culprit you speak of is after me...

41200|0x00373EDA|Mare revealed herself.

41204|0x00373F86|If that person is after me, she is probably just calling you here so~she can lure me out.

41206|0x00374053|A wave of disbelief washed over me.

41208|0x003740DC|But that's all the more reason for you to stay hidden!

41218|0x00374329|You might get hurt.

41220|0x00374382|So I can't hide.
41221|0x0037439D|So I can't hide.
41222|0x003743BD|I was rendered speechless.

41228|0x00374546|I wanted to go over and pat Mare's head.
41229|0x00374579|I wanted to go over and pat~Mare's head.
41230|0x003745B1|That's what I should have done. At least that much.
41231|0x003745EF|That's what I should have done.~At least that much.
41232|0x00374632|However, I didn't even get the time to do that.

41234|0x003746DB|I heard footsteps from behind me.

41236|0x00374738|(...Is she here?)

41250|0x003749B3|You're here rather early I see, Kogasaka-san.
41251|0x003749EB|You're here rather early I see,~Kogasaka-san.
41252|0x00374A32|I could say that same thing to you.
41253|0x00374A60|I could say that same thing to~you.
41254|0x00374A93|Countless stars hung above our heads, twinkling in the night sky, and~a cloud of fireflies soared up from the lookout all at once.

41258|0x00374C0E|Kosame-san in this kind of form truly didn't exist anywhere within my~reality.
41259|0x00374C67|Kosame-san in this kind of form~truly didn't exist anywhere~within my reality.
41260|0x00374CCF|Actually, you are the one truly here ahead of time, isn't that right?

41262|0x00374D7E|You arrived here before me, and waited for me.
41263|0x00374DB7|You arrived here before me, and~waited for me.
41264|0x00374DFF|Then once I came, you laid in wait for the moment when Mare revealed~herself.
41265|0x00374E57|Then once I came, you laid in~wait for the moment when Mare~revealed herself.
41266|0x00374EC0|That's right.
41267|0x00374ED8|That's right.
41268|0x00374EFF|And I guess that if Mare hadn't shown herself, you wouldn't have~popped out at our scheduled time of 9:00 p.m.

41271|0x0037501A|That's right.
41272|0x00375041|Of course, your thinking was that, after waiting here long after that,~not seeing you anywhere in sight, I might've gotten careless and~called Mare.

41275|0x00375187|That's right.
41276|0x003751AE|So really, this has nothing to do with me at all. This is all just a~clever ruse to pull Mare out.

41284|0x00375456|There is no need for thanks. Rather, I feel apologetic for having~summoned you here on such short notice.

41298|0x00375896|Your objective might only be Mare, but considering you summoned me~here, there's got to be something you want to talk to me about, right?

41304|0x00375AC2|Exactly.

41307|0x00375B1C|What do you want with her?
41308|0x00375B46|Kosame-san sighed lightly.

41310|0x00375B95|Like she was sneering at us.

41314|0x00375CA2|My reason for attacking her is because it is a necessary action.

41322|0x00375E81|I cannot be seen by others, so I had to force her to leave.
41323|0x00375EC7|I cannot be seen by others, so~I had to force her to leave.
41324|0x00375F1C|Then why aren't you attacking me?

41326|0x00375F85|The lookout being sealed off would likely be problematic for you, so I~know you won't contact the police.

41328|0x0037607E|I can tell how attached you are to this place.

41330|0x00376133|Kosame-san took one step forward.

41332|0x0037619A|Mare!

41336|0x0037623A|Disappear and run away!

41338|0x0037629A|That's futile.

41342|0x00376328|She was still tightly grasping my clothes.

41344|0x003763E6|What's wrong, Mare?! Just disappear and leave like you always do!
41345|0x00376432|What's wrong, Mare?! Just~disappear and leave like you~always do!
41346|0x00376483|I couldn't turn around to her, because it was too dangerous to take my~eyes off Kosame-san for even one second.

41938|0x00381280|Hisakaki's eyes, however, were closed shut.

41972|0x00381A1D|That might not be all too bad either.
41973|0x00381A4D|That might not be all too bad~either.
41974|0x00381A8E|After all, you know what they say. The closer two people are, the more~they fight.

41977|0x00381BC2|With the kiss over, Hisakaki~drew back her lips, and~Kosame-san leaned onto her.
41978|0x00381C22|Her body became limp, like a doll with its strings cut.

41988|0x00381E7A|But perhaps she actually was crying.
41989|0x00381EA9|But perhaps she actually was~crying.
41990|0x00381EE9|Kosame's always been a bit of a spoiled girl. She'd immediately break~into tears if I didn't give her enough attention.

41993|0x00382038|At those times, I always~soothed her like that.
41994|0x00382083|Though, of course it was usually just kisses on the cheek and~forehead.
41995|0x003820D5|Though, of course it was~usually just kisses on the~cheek and forehead.
41996|0x00382138|That was the first time I kissed anyone on the lips...

41998|0x003821BF|She muttered reminiscently, while embracing Kosame-san.
41999|0x00382201|She muttered reminiscently,~while embracing Kosame-san.
42000|0x00382254|Now that she's older and more mature, it might seem like she's grown~out of that phase, but really she's still the same girl I grew up~with.

42009|0x003825BE|After carefully laying down~Kosame-san, Hisakaki tightly~gripped her injured hand.
42010|0x00382620|The pain and anguish finally showed on her face.

42016|0x003827F2|I took out a handkerchief and pressed it against her palm. It was~soaked in blood within mere moments.

42048|0x00383231|Ah...!
42049|0x00383242|Ah...!
42050|0x003832A5|When I was done calling Shino-san, Maddo suddenly flew up into the air~from Mare's arms.

42052|0x0038337A|Huh... Why...

42054|0x003833B9|It looks like he only lost consciousness.
42055|0x003833ED|It looks like he only lost~consciousness.
42056|0x00383426|He was already vigorously soaring around above Mare's head like~nothing even happened.
42057|0x00383487|He was already vigorously~soaring around above Mare's~head like nothing even~happened.
42058|0x00383545|Ah... Maggy...

42064|0x0038366F|I patted Mare's head gently.
42065|0x00383696|I patted Mare's head gently.
42066|0x003836C2|Mare broke into tears, paying no heed to the people who might see.
42067|0x0038370F|Mare broke into tears, paying~no heed to the people who might~see.
42068|0x00383781|She was trembling.

42070|0x003837C0|I can understand how she must have felt.
42071|0x003837F3|I can understand how she must~have felt.
42072|0x0038382B|She displayed an immense amount of courage with that tiny body of~hers.
42073|0x0038387D|She displayed an immense amount~of courage with that tiny body~of hers.
42074|0x003838D4|So what if she's an illusory dream?
42075|0x00383902|So what if she's an illusory~dream?
42076|0x00383935|Whether she's a shinigami, an alien, or even an illusory dream, none~of that matters.
42077|0x00383995|Whether she's a shinigami, an~alien, or even an illusory~dream, none of that matters.
42078|0x003839FA|Hisakaki taught me that.
42079|0x00383A1D|Hisakaki taught me that.
42080|0x00383A45|If Mare is right here, if I can feel her warmth, and she definitely~has a heart of her own...
42081|0x00383AAD|If Mare is right here, if I can~feel her warmth, and she~definitely has a heart of her~own...
42082|0x00383B1A|Then Mare is, without question, my friend.
42083|0x00383B4F|Then Mare is, without question,~my friend.
42084|0x00383C0B|Hidden behind cover, Suwa Setsuna watched over what had just~transpired at the lookout.
42085|0x00383C6D|Hidden behind cover, Suwa~Setsuna watched over what had~just transpired at the lookout.
42086|0x00383D06|Setsuna had intended to send Mare back tonight.
42087|0x00383D40|Setsuna had intended to send~Mare back tonight.
42088|0x00383D7F|Since Setsuna didn't possess a cellphone, the Astro Club only had her~apartment telephone's number.
42089|0x00383DED|Since Setsuna didn't possess a~cellphone, the Astro Club only~had her apartment telephone's~number.
42090|0x00383E60|Naturally, that meant she couldn't message You either, so she asked~Kosame for her cooperation.
42091|0x00383ECA|Naturally, that meant she~couldn't message You either, so~she asked Kosame for her~cooperation.
42092|0x00383F39|The plan was to summon him to the lookout and then lure Mare out.
42093|0x00383F85|The plan was to summon him to~the lookout and then lure Mare~out.
42094|0x00383FD6|Once she was out, she would then reap Mare.
42095|0x0038400C|Once she was out, she would~then reap Mare.
42096|0x00384047|If You harbored any sort of suspicions towards Kosame, she had~intended to nix those right there.

42098|0x00384124|She would have told him that she threatened Kosame and forced her to~do what she wanted. Setsuna had meant to make herself out to be the~perpetrator, while Kosame was nothing but a victim.
42099|0x003841EB|She would have told him that~she threatened Kosame and~forced her to do what she~wanted. Setsuna had meant to
42100|0x00384268|The way she saw things, she would eventually leave Hibarigasaki~anyway, so it didn't matter what people thought of her.

42102|0x00384361|Normally, it would have been her who laid in wait for You and Mare at~the lookout.
42103|0x003843BE|Normally, it would have been~her who laid in wait for You~and Mare at the lookout.
42104|0x00384420|It was when the relic, the naginata which was kept in the shrine's~main building, disappeared without anyone noticing that the plan went~off the rails.
42105|0x003844C2|It was when the relic, the~naginata which was kept in the~shrine's main building,~disappeared without anyone
42106|0x0038453E|After her conversation with Komomo on the shrine grounds, Setsuna~entered the shrine's main building and learned it was missing.

42112|0x003847BE|There, she found You and Kosame in a confrontation.
42113|0x003847FC|There, she found You and Kosame~in a confrontation.
42114|0x0038483F|As Setsuna watched things play out from her hiding place, Komomo~showed up.
42115|0x00384895|As Setsuna watched things play~out from her hiding place,~Komomo showed up.
42116|0x003848F0|She assumed Komomo must have noticed that Kosame wasn't at home, so~she went to find her sister.
42117|0x0038495B|She assumed Komomo must have~noticed that Kosame wasn't at~home, so she went to find her~sister.
42118|0x003849CB|Komomo is a clever girl, so she must have deduced from her~conversation with Setsuna that Kosame's destination was the lookout.

42121|0x00384B48|...Guess I'll leave then.
42122|0x00384B71|Hearing You call for someone to pick them up, she decided to take her~leave before it got too noisy.
42123|0x00384BE0|Hearing You call for someone to~pick them up, she decided to~take her leave before it got~too noisy.
42124|0x00384C73|What drove Kosame to do something like that?

42126|0x00384CE6|It made no sense to Setsuna.
42127|0x00384D0D|It made no sense to Setsuna.
42128|0x00384D39|But there was a vague possibility that crossed her mind.

42131|0x00384E15|If Setsuna sent Mare back, then~You would have ended up~resenting her.

42134|0x00384F66|Meaning that she would've attacked both Mare and You.
42135|0x00384FA6|Meaning that she would've~attacked both Mare and You.
42136|0x00384FEB|That would have given birth to strife between not only her and You,~but consequently also her and the Astro Club.

42289|0x003883E4|She added an excuse, awkwardly.
42290|0x0038842D|...Well, since you're a class rep at the end of the day, I guess it's~only reasonable you'd be worried.

42591|0x0038E9E1|...She doesn't sound too~excited.
42592|0x0038EA47|It sounds just like Hisakaki-kun, but it's also like we've lost the~timing to celebrate with that.
42593|0x0038EAB4|It sounds just like~Hisakaki-kun, but it's also~like we've lost the timing to~celebrate with that.
42594|0x0038EB40|Well, at least it's a better outcome than if we hadn't become a club.
42595|0x0038EB90|Well, at least it's a better~outcome than if we hadn't~become a club.
42596|0x0038EBEF|Right. Still a cause for celebration, I think.

42602|0x0038EDE0|Maybe she decided to inform us through a text message because she~wanted to avoid that very outcome.
42603|0x0038EE4F|Maybe she decided to inform us~through a text message because~she wanted to avoid that very~outcome.
42604|0x0038EEF7|Kinda funny though when you think about it. Us now being a club~coincidentally means she's officially a member herself.
42605|0x0038EF79|Kinda funny though when you~think about it. Us now being a~club coincidentally means she's~officially a member herself.
42606|0x0038F00E|And not only her. That made Mare an official club member too.
42607|0x0038F056|And not only her. That made~Mare an official club member~too.
42608|0x0038F0D1|So has Hisakaki left already?
42609|0x0038F0F9|So has Hisakaki left already?
42610|0x0038F140|I would think so. She was acting rather eager to finally get her~bandage off.
42611|0x0038F198|I would think so. She was~acting rather eager to finally~get her bandage off.
42612|0x0038F1F5|Which probably means she headed straight to the hospital right after~their meeting was over.
42613|0x0038F25C|Which probably means she headed~straight to the hospital right~after their meeting was over.

42631|0x0038F783|...Well, see, it's kinda like,~I've got to take~responsibility.
42632|0x0038F7D2|I was partly responsible for her injury, after all.
42633|0x0038F810|I was partly responsible for~her injury, after all.

42881|0x0039432E|That's right. There's a hallway~connecting the two wards,~though.
42882|0x00394389|So basically, it's a three-story hospital with two wards?

44749|0x003B8758|That's right. Most of the~patients are elderly, and even~the younger ones are in at~least their thirties.

44752|0x003B8906|...Has she been hospitalized for a long time?
44753|0x003B893E|...Has she been hospitalized~for a long time?
44754|0x003B8995|I wasn't told. Though apparently she was staying at a different one~outside of this prefecture before they transferred her here in July...
44755|0x003B8A2A|I wasn't told. Though~apparently she was staying at a~different one outside of this~prefecture before they
44756|0x003B8AA4|So she really was outside of Hibarigasaki?
44757|0x003B8AD9|So she really was outside of~Hibarigasaki?
44758|0x003B8B1D|Did she, like... get injured really badly or something? Or is it a~type of illness?
44759|0x003B8B7B|Did she, like... get injured~really badly or something? Or~is it a type of illness?
44760|0x003B8BEC|Hisakaki and Kosame-san exchanged glances.
44761|0x003B8C21|Hisakaki and Kosame-san~exchanged glances.
44762|0x003B8C65|You said the west ward handles patients with serious conditions,~right? Since they have her here, does that mean it's something...~really serious...?
44763|0x003B8D05|You said the west ward handles~patients with serious~conditions, right? Since they~have her here, does that mean
44764|0x003B8D9F|...I don't know.
44765|0x003B8DBA|...I don't know.
44766|0x003B8DF4|Information like that isn't given to just anyone. You have to~essentially be close family to the person in question...

44768|0x003B8F15|I doubt our dad would tell us even if we asked him.
44769|0x003B8F53|I doubt our dad would tell us~even if we asked him.
44770|0x003B8F96|Asking a doctor or nurse about confidential information like that is~essentially pointless.
44771|0x003B8FFC|Asking a doctor or nurse about~confidential information like~that is essentially pointless.
44772|0x003B9067|And directly asking her wouldn't be that easy either.
44773|0x003B90A7|And directly asking her~wouldn't be that easy either.
44774|0x003B90EC|However, be it injury or disease, I still couldn't really see it being~all that bad.
44775|0x003B914B|However, be it injury or~disease, I still couldn't~really see it being all that~bad.
44776|0x003B91D6|After all, I had run across Yume outside several times.
44777|0x003B9218|After all, I had run across~Yume outside several times.
44778|0x003B925F|I felt nearly 100% positive it was her that I saw.
44779|0x003B929C|I felt nearly 100% positive it~was her that I saw.
44780|0x003B92DE|So, to be precise, me visiting her now wouldn't amount to our reunion.~We had already managed to meet again.
44781|0x003B9355|So, to be precise, me visiting~her now wouldn't amount to our~reunion. We had already managed~to meet again.
44782|0x003B93D1|Yume's condition was one that allowed her to walk around outside.
44783|0x003B941D|Yume's condition was one that~allowed her to walk around~outside.
44784|0x003B946E|I didn't know why she was hospitalized. However, it wasn't the kind of~condition that kept her confined to bed.
44785|0x003B94E8|I didn't know why she was~hospitalized. However, it~wasn't the kind of condition~that kept her confined to bed.

44787|0x003B9608|She was so cheerful and full of~energy as a kid.
44788|0x003B9648|So in my head, I felt positive she would recover in no time.

44794|0x003B9886|Compared to the noise of the central ward where the reception and~lobby are located, this place seemed like a different world.

44804|0x003B9BFC|On the one hand, I was grateful for their consideration, but on the~other hand, it was slightly embarrassing.

44806|0x003B9CF1|I stepped inside the room, feeling the pounding of my heart in~anticipation.

44808|0x003B9DE3|It was a private hospital room.
