25155|0x0023D179|...That isn't any of your~business.
25156|0x0023D1B6|Then won't you renew our relationship so it will be?
25157|0x0023D1F5|Then won't you renew our~relationship so it will be?
25158|0x0023D253|...I'll sue you for sexual harassment.
25159|0x0023D284|...I'll sue you for sexual~harassment.
25160|0x0023D2C4|I still won't give up.
25161|0x0023D2E5|I still won't give up.
25162|0x0023D325|...Not only Chinami-san, but you, too.
25163|0x0023D356|...Not only Chinami-san, but~you, too.
25164|0x0023D38C|Aoi-san sighed.
25165|0x0023D3A6|Aoi-san sighed.
25166|0x0023D3DF|What worth is there in involving yourselves with me...
25167|0x0023D420|What worth is there in~involving yourselves with me...
25168|0x0023D470|Well, we wanna be friends with you.
25169|0x0023D49E|Well, we wanna be friends with~you.
25170|0x0023D4D1|A look of exasperation.
25171|0x0023D4F3|A look of exasperation.
25172|0x0023D534|...And there's no merit in achieving that.
25173|0x0023D569|...And there's no merit in~achieving that.
25174|0x0023D5AD|But, the thing is, that's not your decision to make.
25175|0x0023D5EC|But, the thing is, that's not~your decision to make.
25176|0x0023D64A|So what, it's something for you to decide?
25177|0x0023D67F|So what, it's something for you~to decide?
25178|0x0023D6C3|Nope.
25179|0x0023D6D3|Nope.
25180|0x0023D6E8|Then, I said with excitement...
25181|0x0023D712|Then, I said with excitement...
25182|0x0023D74B|I'm saying that's not our present selves' decision to make.
25183|0x0023D791|I'm saying that's not our~present selves' decision to~make.
25184|0x0023D7FB|Much like how the person who sees the girl from the lookout with~affection is not my past self but the me of now.
25185|0x0023D877|Much like how the person who~sees the girl from the lookout~with affection is not my past~self but the me of now.
25186|0x0023D8F8|If our future selves don't regret the fact that we became friends,~then that is all that counts.
25187|0x0023D963|If our future selves don't~regret the fact that we became~friends, then that is all that~counts.
25188|0x0023DA5E|Hey, Chinami, did you know that Aoi-san has a telescope?
25189|0x0023DAA1|Hey, Chinami, did you know that~Aoi-san has a telescope?
25190|0x0023DAEE|I asked that question of Chinami, who had quite unusually gotten up~early, and also quite unusually she was already wearing her uniform.
25191|0x0023DB81|I asked that question of~Chinami, who had quite~unusually gotten up early, and~also quite unusually she was
25192|0x0023DC35|Hmm? Don't you mean those tarot cards?
25193|0x0023DC66|Hmm? Don't you mean those tarot~cards?
25194|0x0023DCA6|Well, she also has a telescope. I just found out yesterday.
25195|0x0023DCEC|Well, she also has a telescope.~I just found out yesterday.
25196|0x0023DD51|Oh I see. Maybe she's on the lookout for UFOs?
25197|0x0023DD8A|Oh I see. Maybe she's on the~lookout for UFOs?
25198|0x0023DDD2|Uh, normally a telescope is for stargazing.
25199|0x0023DE08|Uh, normally a telescope is for~stargazing.
25200|0x0023DE5D|Onii-chan, are you still trying to recruit her to the Astro Club?
25201|0x0023DEA9|Onii-chan, are you still trying~to recruit her to the Astro~Club?
25202|0x0023DF04|I guess so.
25203|0x0023DF1A|I guess so.
25204|0x0023DF5A|You can't do that Onii-chan! Girls all hate the guys that won't leave~'em alone! I know Aoi-chan and she's always predicting with her cards~the fateful time her dream of getting into contact with~extraterrestrial life will come true!
25205|0x0023E04E|You can't do that Onii-chan!~Girls all hate the guys that~won't leave 'em alone! I know~Aoi-chan and she's always
25206|0x0023E0CF|That last part was Chinami's usual delusional thinking.
25207|0x0023E111|That last part was Chinami's~usual delusional thinking.
25208|0x0023E162|Does she do divination with her tarot cards in the classroom?
25209|0x0023E1AA|Does she do divination with her~tarot cards in the classroom?
25210|0x0023E211|During breaks sometimes yeah.
25211|0x0023E239|During breaks sometimes yeah.
25212|0x0023E270|What kind of results does she get?
25213|0x0023E29D|What kind of results does she~get?
25214|0x0023E2E9|Rather than looking into the future it's kinda like she wishes for~something. She said it's like a good luck charm for her.
25215|0x0023E36F|Rather than looking into the~future it's kinda like she~wishes for something. She said~it's like a good luck charm for
25216|0x0023E3F5|You can use tarot cards for something like that, too?
25217|0x0023E435|You can use tarot cards for~something like that, too?
25218|0x0023E484|What's she wishing for?
25219|0x0023E4A6|What's she wishing for?
25220|0x0023E4E7|Dunno. She won't tell me.
25221|0x0023E50B|Dunno. She won't tell me.
25222|0x0023E534|If not even Chinami can get that out of her, it might have been plain~pointless for me to even ask.
25223|0x0023E5A2|If not even Chinami can get~that out of her, it might have~been plain pointless for me to~even ask.
25224|0x0023E61F|In your opinion, do you think Aoi-san loves the stars?
25225|0x0023E660|In your opinion, do you think~Aoi-san loves the stars?
25226|0x0023E6C0|I think Aoi-chan absolutely loves aliens!
25227|0x0023E6F4|I think Aoi-chan absolutely~loves aliens!
25228|0x0023E737|Okay, I was being serious. Jokes aside, what do you think?
25229|0x0023E77C|Okay, I was being serious.~Jokes aside, what do you think?
25230|0x0023E7E0|I'm never joking around! I'm always serious-mode Chinami!
25231|0x0023E824|I'm never joking around! I'm~always serious-mode Chinami!
25232|0x0023E877|Chinami aside, what do you think?
25233|0x0023E8A3|Chinami aside, what do you~think?
25234|0x0023E8F9|If you put me aside, then I'm not even in this conversation,~Onii-chan!
25235|0x0023E94B|If you put me aside, then I'm~not even in this conversation,~Onii-chan!
25236|0x0023E9A2|This conversation was going absolutely nowhere.
25237|0x0023E9DC|This conversation was going~absolutely nowhere.
25238|0x0023EA25|I guess it's about time I get going.
25239|0x0023EA54|I guess it's about time I get~going.
25240|0x0023EAA2|Oh! Hold on, hold on! I'll be ready in just a sec!
25241|0x0023EADF|Oh! Hold on, hold on! I'll be~ready in just a sec!
25242|0x0023EB30|I proceeded to casually ask Chinami something, as she was in the~process of getting up.
25243|0x0023EB92|I proceeded to casually ask~Chinami something, as she was~in the process of getting up.
25244|0x0023EC19|Say, Chinami, why do you want to be friends with Aoi-san?
25245|0x0023EC5D|Say, Chinami, why do you want~to be friends with Aoi-san?
25246|0x0023ECD9|Isn't that crystal clear?
25247|0x0023ECFD|Isn't that crystal clear?
25248|0x0023ED26|And then, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, she~said...
25249|0x0023ED78|And then, as if it was the most~natural thing in the world, she~said...
25250|0x0023EDFD|Because I love her!

25258|0x0023EFAF|Aoi-san merely shot us a quick glance and then resumed trekking up the~hill.
25259|0x0023F006|Aoi-san merely shot us a quick~glance and then resumed~trekking up the hill.

25262|0x0023F0F2|Chinami chased after her.
25263|0x0023F116|Chinami chased after her.
25264|0x0023F13F|Somehow this had become our daily routine every morning.
25265|0x0023F182|Somehow this had become our~daily routine every morning.
25266|0x0023F218|So how do you think you've done on your exams so far, Aoi-san?
25267|0x0023F261|So how do you think you've done~on your exams so far, Aoi-san?
25268|0x0023F2C9|...Same as always.

25272|0x0023F3C3|...I'm not.
25273|0x0023F3D9|...I'm not.
25274|0x0023F40E|Next time maybe you can help me cheat!
25275|0x0023F43F|Next time maybe you can help me~cheat!
25276|0x0023F48F|...Instead of tutoring, you just want help cheating.
25277|0x0023F4CE|...Instead of tutoring, you~just want help cheating.
25278|0x0023F51C|As her big brother, I'd appreciate it if you could help her without~cheating.
25279|0x0023F574|As her big brother, I'd~appreciate it if you could help~her without cheating.
25280|0x0023F612|Oh, but that is a tall order, Onii-chan! I was born to use the sword~rather than the pen, and if I have to use my head, I'd much rather use~the outside than the inside!
25281|0x0023F6C5|Oh, but that is a tall order,~Onii-chan! I was born to use~the sword rather than the pen,~and if I have to use my head,

25283|0x0023F784|You're gonna do a headbutt or~what?
25284|0x0023F7EA|...Come to think of it, she often slams her head against the desk in~class when she dozes off.
25285|0x0023F853|...Come to think of it, she~often slams her head against~the desk in class when she~dozes off.
25286|0x0023F8CB|You're keeping a good eye on her.
25287|0x0023F8F7|You're keeping a good eye on~her.
25288|0x0023F942|...I end up witnessing that even if I don't want to. It's hard to miss~since I sit directly behind her.
25289|0x0023F9B4|...I end up witnessing that~even if I don't want to. It's~hard to miss since I sit~directly behind her.
25290|0x0023FA45|Alright, so when I give you a thumbs-up during a test that'll be our~little sign! You'll accidentally drop your answer sheet and when I~pick it up for you I'll exchange it with mine! That's the plan!

25327|0x00240555|...Do you think she's mad at~me?
25328|0x0024058F|Wasn't the best thing to say, I guess.
25329|0x002405C0|Wasn't the best thing to say, I~guess.
25330|0x0024061B|It sure as heck wasn't! If Aoi-chan won't show me her answer sheet all~'cause of this then I'm gonna hold a nasty grudge against you!

25332|0x00240736|You like to use the outside of your head, yeah?
25333|0x00240770|You like to use the outside of~your head, yeah?
25334|0x00240819|That doesn't mean I want to use it for noogies, Onii-chan?!
25335|0x0024085F|That doesn't mean I want to use~it for noogies, Onii-chan?!

25392|0x00241B7D|As those two started introducing themselves to each other, we started~chatting with Asuka.
25393|0x00241BE2|As those two started~introducing themselves to each~other, we started chatting with~Asuka.
25394|0x00241CA7|The Occult Club's out there giving it their all too, huh?
25395|0x00241CEB|The Occult Club's out there~giving it their all too, huh?
25396|0x00241D3E|How's Chinami doing? Is she of any use?
25397|0x00241D70|How's Chinami doing? Is she of~any use?
25398|0x00241DB3|She is pretty damn good at interviewing people, let me tell you. I~mean, she just charges right at those students no matter who they are.
25399|0x00241E47|She is pretty damn good at~interviewing people, let me~tell you. I mean, she just~charges right at those students
25400|0x00241EC8|Yeah, I can see that.
25401|0x00241EE8|Yeah, I can see that.
25402|0x00241F27|Well, seeing how Chinami-chan's a first-year herself and all, we~concentrated on first-years for questioning.
25403|0x00241F9F|Well, seeing how Chinami-chan's~a first-year herself and all,~we concentrated on first-years~for questioning.
25404|0x00242036|Makes sense. The majority of the upperclassmen have already lost~interest in the urban legend.
25405|0x0024209F|Makes sense. The majority of~the upperclassmen have already~lost interest in the urban~legend.
25406|0x00242127|So yeah, we went around asking students to tell us anything they might~know about the urban legend, but like...
25407|0x002421A1|So yeah, we went around asking~students to tell us anything~they might know about the urban~legend, but like...
25408|0x0024223A|Did you learn anything?
25409|0x0024225C|Did you learn anything?
25410|0x0024229D|Most of 'em were just your run-of-the-mill rumors you hear everywhere.
25411|0x002422EE|Most of 'em were just your~run-of-the-mill rumors you hear~everywhere.
25412|0x00242344|After that, Asuka opened his notepad.
25413|0x00242374|After that, Asuka opened his~notepad.
25414|0x002423C3|But still there is one piece of information that caught my attention.
25415|0x00242413|But still there is one piece of~information that caught my~attention.
25416|0x00242482|Oh, what is it?
25417|0x0024249C|Oh, what is it?
25418|0x002424BB|Asuho was very curious about it, as expected of someone who wants to~ride on a UFO.
25419|0x00242519|Asuho was very curious about~it, as expected of someone who~wants to ride on a UFO.
25420|0x00242596|Believe it or not, there were actually students who claimed to have~seen the shinigami.
25421|0x002425F8|Believe it or not, there were~actually students who claimed~to have seen the shinigami.
25422|0x00242669|Eye witnesses?
25423|0x00242682|Eye witnesses?
25424|0x002426AC|Oh, weird. Has that ever happened before?
25425|0x002426E0|Oh, weird. Has that ever~happened before?
25426|0x00242733|Well usually when I ask, people have heard about the shinigami story~from their friends, but that's all.
25427|0x002427A6|Well usually when I ask, people~have heard about the shinigami~story from their friends, but~that's all.
25428|0x0024285D|Yet this time, there are students who claim to have seen the shinigami~with their own eyes.
25429|0x002428C3|Yet this time, there are~students who claim to have seen~the shinigami with their own~eyes.
25430|0x00242966|What's more, there were a bunch of those people. Not just one or two!
25431|0x002429B6|What's more, there were a bunch~of those people. Not just one~or two!
25432|0x00242A0B|The other two joined the conversation as well.
25433|0x00242A44|The other two joined the~conversation as well.
25434|0x00242A9C|Oh? Actually sounds credible then.
25435|0x00242AC9|Oh? Actually sounds credible~then.
25436|0x00242B0B|...You aren't gonna tell me that was actually Mare, are you?
25437|0x00242B52|...You aren't gonna tell me~that was actually Mare, are~you?
25438|0x00242BEB|The shinigami you guys saw at the lookout, yeah? Coulda been her,~coulda not.
25439|0x00242C43|The shinigami you guys saw at~the lookout, yeah? Coulda been~her, coulda not.
25440|0x00242CBA|This time 'round, it seems the sighting spot is right here at this~school.
25441|0x00242D0F|This time 'round, it seems the~sighting spot is right here at~this school.
25442|0x00242D80|Asuka pointed at the school building behind him with his thumb.
25443|0x00242DCA|Asuka pointed at the school~building behind him with his~thumb.
25444|0x00242E29|...They saw a shinigami here at Hibari High?
25445|0x00242E60|...They saw a shinigami here at~Hibari High?
25446|0x00242ECB|What they say.
25447|0x00242EE4|What they say.
25448|0x00242F02|Asuka gave a placid nod and went on.
25449|0x00242F31|Asuka gave a placid nod and~went on.
25450|0x00242F7F|We got four witnesses in total, all of 'em girls. The four of the lot~are classmates and members of the tennis team. Well, a group of~friends basically.
25451|0x00243022|We got four witnesses in total,~all of 'em girls. The four of~the lot are classmates and~members of the tennis team.
25452|0x002430B2|So when they got done with after-school practice, they'd been chatting~at the tennis court till it was already dark out 'fore they knew it,~when one of the four remembered somethin' they forgot in the school~building.
25453|0x00243196|So when they got done with~after-school practice, they'd~been chatting at the tennis~court till it was already dark
25454|0x00243233|At our school, they don't close the entrance at night, plus the~security's also pretty sloppy, which's why the four headed to their~classroom together to get the item.
25455|0x002432E5|At our school, they don't close~the entrance at night, plus the~security's also pretty sloppy,~which's why the four headed to
25456|0x0024338C|That was when it happened.
25457|0x002433B1|That was when it happened.
25458|0x002433DB|Asuka continued in a theatrically low voice.
25459|0x00243412|Asuka continued in a~theatrically low voice.
25460|0x00243468|They saw a child with a huge scythe walking down the hallway all~alone...
25461|0x002434BC|They saw a child with a huge~scythe walking down the hallway~all alone...
25462|0x00243515|He clapped his notepad shut.
25463|0x0024353C|He clapped his notepad shut.
25464|0x0024359F|...A kid?
25465|0x002435B3|...A kid?
25466|0x002435E6|According to their testimony, they couldn't really make out the person~well since it was dark and all, but apparently it was someone with a~relatively small build, so I don't think there's any mistaking that~they were a kid.
25467|0x002436D1|According to their testimony,~they couldn't really make out~the person well since it was~dark and all, but apparently it
25468|0x00243790|They were able to see the huge scythe despite the miniscule amount of~light?
25469|0x002437E7|They were able to see the huge~scythe despite the miniscule~amount of light?
25470|0x0024385D|Said they couldn't make that out clearly either. Still, apparently the~person was carrying a long pole on their shoulder, so not much else it~could be.
25471|0x002438FF|Said they couldn't make that~out clearly either. Still,~apparently the person was~carrying a long pole on their
25472|0x00243998|Can't have a shinigami without a scythe.
25473|0x002439CB|Can't have a shinigami without~a scythe.
25474|0x00243A03|Listening to his information only further convinced me that it was~Mare.
25475|0x00243A56|Listening to his information~only further convinced me that~it was Mare.
25476|0x00243AF1|Nothing on their appearance or gender?
25477|0x00243B22|Nothing on their appearance or~gender?
25478|0x00243B64|Nope. Small stature, was carrying a long pole on their shoulder. In~actual fact, that's all there is in terms of concrete information.
25479|0x00243BF5|Nope. Small stature, was~carrying a long pole on their~shoulder. In actual fact,~that's all there is in terms of
25480|0x00243CAD|Did Mare-chan came over to play at Hibari High?! Did she come over to~say hi to us?!
25481|0x00243D0C|Did Mare-chan came over to play~at Hibari High?! Did she come~over to say hi to us?!
25482|0x00243D70|Judging from Mare's personality, that was actually very unlikely.
25483|0x00243DBC|Judging from Mare's~personality, that was actually~very unlikely.
25484|0x00243E27|So yeah, like that turned out to be the greatest finding since the~Occult Club's foundation. Now we just wait for nightfall, and then~it'll be time for us to make our stakeout at Hibari High.
25485|0x00243EF1|So yeah, like that turned out~to be the greatest finding~since the Occult Club's~foundation. Now we just wait
25486|0x00243F88|This very night it's school building exploration time together with~Occult Prez!
25487|0x00243FE3|This very night it's school~building exploration time~together with Occult Prez!
25488|0x0024404D|...Uh, for real?
25489|0x00244068|...Uh, for real?
25490|0x002440CC|Yep! And if I get to see Mare-chan we'll be best buddies in no time!
25491|0x0024411B|Yep! And if I get to see~Mare-chan we'll be best buddies~in no time!
25492|0x00244179|Nope.
25493|0x00244189|Nope.
25494|0x002441C9|Why?!
25495|0x002441D9|Why?!
25496|0x002441F8|I know you're just planning to use it to ditch studying for your~exams.
25497|0x0024424A|I know you're just planning to~use it to ditch studying for~your exams.
25498|0x002442BB|But c'mon! C'mon! I just gotta! My grand ambition of becoming friends~with an alien and having it let me ride on its UFO has a very real~chance of becoming a reality!

25501|0x00244437|Well, you've told me about that~before, so I know.
25502|0x00244493|So you'll let me off the hook then?!
25503|0x002444C2|So you'll let me off the hook~then?!
25504|0x00244500|I will if you just sign here.
25505|0x00244528|I will if you just sign here.

25510|0x00244684|I ardently plead you to take a chill pill please, Onii-chan!
25511|0x002446CB|I ardently plead you to take a~chill pill please, Onii-chan!
25512|0x0024474C|...Well, I can understand you'd be worried about her.
25513|0x0024478C|...Well, I can understand you'd~be worried about her.
25514|0x00244808|Yeah, You-chan really cares about Chinami-chan.
25515|0x00244842|Yeah, You-chan really cares~about Chinami-chan.
25516|0x00244881|Why did they take it like that?
25517|0x002448AB|Why did they take it like that?
25518|0x002448F4|But I even got myself a handy dandy bug catching net ready beforehand~in eager anticipation of the day when I'll be able to catch an alien!
25519|0x0024498A|But I even got myself a handy~dandy bug catching net ready~beforehand in eager~anticipation of the day when
25520|0x00244A0F|No, uh, I don't think alien hunting is the same as bug catching.
25521|0x00244A5A|No, uh, I don't think alien~hunting is the same as bug~catching.
25522|0x00244AEB|I also have to say that a stakeout at night is dangerous. If security~happens to find you, you will be in for a world of unpleasantness.
25523|0x00244B7E|I also have to say that a~stakeout at night is dangerous.~If security happens to find~you, you will be in for a world
25524|0x00244C1D|Wouldn't it be better to put that off until summer break? Kinda like,~with a test of courage mixed in as well vibe.

25528|0x00244D93|Asuka heaved a weary sigh.
25529|0x00244DB8|Asuka heaved a weary sigh.
25530|0x00244E2F|Meh, it is what it is. We do got finals all week and all. Wouldn't be~a problem to just hold it off till summer break anyway.

25542|0x00245247|Just your imagination.
25543|0x00245268|Just your imagination.

25554|0x00245610|Somehow, the two of them make a nice team.
25555|0x00245645|Somehow, the two of them make a~nice team.
25556|0x00245699|For other people, they just might look like a couple.
25557|0x002456D9|For other people, they just~might look like a couple.
25558|0x00245728|......
25559|0x00245739|......
25560|0x00245769|You-chan, you're making that look like a big brother wanting to go~scare off the guy chasing after his little sister.
25561|0x002457E9|You-chan, you're making that~look like a big brother wanting~to go scare off the guy chasing~after his little sister.
25562|0x0024586E|That couldn't be further from the truth.
25563|0x002458A1|That couldn't be further from~the truth.
25564|0x00245918|After I finished handing out flyers and saying goodbye to the others,~I decided to swing by Aoi-san's place.
25565|0x0024598F|After I finished handing out~flyers and saying goodbye to~the others, I decided to swing~by Aoi-san's place.
25566|0x00245A0B|But just the same as yesterday, there was no one home.

25570|0x00245B5A|Onee-chan went somewhere again today.
25571|0x00245B8A|Onee-chan went somewhere again~today.
25572|0x00245BC5|I asked Suzuha-chan, who was over at our house to play.
25573|0x00245C07|I asked Suzuha-chan, who was~over at our house to play.
25574|0x00245C68|Sorry, I don't know where she went... She doesn't tell me even when I~ask her.
25575|0x00245CC1|Sorry, I don't know where she~went... She doesn't tell me~even when I ask her.
25576|0x00245D2B|She said, 'I'm sorry I can't play with you,' and then left still~wearing her school uniform...
25577|0x00245D94|She said, 'I'm sorry I can't~play with you,' and then left~still wearing her school~uniform...
25578|0x00245E1C|There's also times where she goes out and takes her telescope with~her... but that's generally only after it's already dark out.
25579|0x00245EA7|There's also times where she~goes out and takes her~telescope with her... but~that's generally only after
25580|0x00245F3A|Well, a telescope being what it is, I believe she must be stargazing~somewhere...
25581|0x00245F96|Well, a telescope being what it~is, I believe she must be~stargazing somewhere...
25582|0x00246001|Thanks. That is plenty helpful.
25583|0x0024602B|Thanks. That is plenty helpful.
25584|0x00246091|Onii-chan, are you gonna go look for her?
25585|0x002460C5|Onii-chan, are you gonna go~look for her?
25586|0x00246108|Yeah. Let Shino-san know that I might be home late.
25587|0x00246146|Yeah. Let Shino-san know that I~might be home late.
25588|0x002461A3|U-Um, if you have something to say to Onee-chan, I can give you her~cellphone number.
25589|0x00246203|U-Um, if you have something to~say to Onee-chan, I can give~you her cellphone number.
25590|0x00246272|Nah, I can't imagine her answering a call from an unknown number.
25591|0x002462BE|Nah, I can't imagine her~answering a call from an~unknown number.
25592|0x00246334|I can attest to that! She hasn't picked up a single time when I try~calling her!
25593|0x0024638F|I can attest to that! She~hasn't picked up a single time~when I try calling her!
25594|0x002463EF|She proclaimed loudly, as if boasting.
25595|0x00246420|She proclaimed loudly, as if~boasting.
25596|0x00246470|That's because it seems like Onee-chan doesn't have a whole lot of~numbers saved in her cellphone contacts list...
25597|0x002464ED|That's because it seems like~Onee-chan doesn't have a whole~lot of numbers saved in her~cellphone contacts list...
25598|0x00246579|That's nothing you have to fret over, Suzuha-chan.
25599|0x002465B6|That's nothing you have to fret~over, Suzuha-chan.
25600|0x002465F8|That's nothing for Aoi-san to be ashamed of either.
25601|0x00246636|That's nothing for Aoi-san to~be ashamed of either.
25602|0x002466A5|I left the living room.
25603|0x002466C7|I left the living room.
25604|0x002466EE|If Aoi-san really was stargazing, then there were only two possible~places in my mind that she could be.
25605|0x00246761|If Aoi-san really was~stargazing, then there were~only two possible places in my~mind that she could be.
25606|0x00246855|Man, I got tired of waiting, Mare.

25608|0x002468EF|...Pretty sure this is the usual time I come here.
25609|0x0024692C|...Pretty sure this is the~usual time I come here.
25610|0x00246978|That's just how badly I missed you.

25672|0x002475E9|A huffy look.

25674|0x0024761E|I came back over to Mare and stood in front of her.
25675|0x0024765C|I came back over to Mare and~stood in front of her.

25678|0x0024772A|I extended my hand towards Mare.
25679|0x00247755|I extended my hand towards~Mare.
25680|0x002477BA|At the same time, her scythe brushed against my throat.

25682|0x0024784D|Why?!
25683|0x0024785D|Why?!
25684|0x0024788A|I feel a malicious intent.
25685|0x002478AF|I feel a malicious intent.
25686|0x002478E3|I was just going to pat your head, geez!
25687|0x00247916|I was just going to pat your~head, geez!
25688|0x00247966|The only punishment fit for you is death.

25690|0x00247A02|As I stood there, frozen, Mare lowered her scythe and stepped back.
25691|0x00247A50|As I stood there, frozen, Mare~lowered her scythe and stepped~back.

25693|0x00247AFC|...Don't you ever do that~again, or I'll slice you up.
25694|0x00247B67|Mare turned around, and just like that she was gone.
25695|0x00247BA6|Mare turned around, and just~like that she was gone.
25696|0x00247BEA|(...Did I make her mad?)

25698|0x00247C35|Instead of worrying about that, though, there was something else I~needed to do.
25699|0x00247C90|Instead of worrying about that,~though, there was something~else I needed to do.
25700|0x00247CF0|I left the lookout behind me.
25701|0x00247D18|I left the lookout behind me.
25702|0x00247D6A|When we were handing out flyers, it crossed my mind as a possibility.
25703|0x00247DBA|When we were handing out~flyers, it crossed my mind as a~possibility.
25704|0x00247E0F|There was that person I saw when Asuho and I dropped by the school~building together at night.
25705|0x00247E78|There was that person I saw~when Asuho and I dropped by the~school building together at~night.
25706|0x00247EE6|And then there was the time I spotted Aoi-san in front of the school~gate with a telescope.
25707|0x00247F4C|And then there was the time I~spotted Aoi-san in front of the~school gate with a telescope.

25709|0x0024800E|Additionally, there was that~shinigami rumor I heard from~Asuka and Chinami.
25710|0x0024806A|That shinigami was holding a huge scythe.
25711|0x0024809E|That shinigami was holding a~huge scythe.
25712|0x002480D7|No... to be precise, they only said it was holding some kind of long~pole.

25714|0x002481BA|The school building remains open, even at night.
25715|0x002481F5|The school building remains~open, even at night.
25716|0x00248235|Maybe that's a token of consideration towards the students whose~after-school activities run exceptionally late, but thanks to that,~even shady characters can easily enter.
25717|0x002482EC|Maybe that's a token of~consideration towards the~students whose after-school~activities run exceptionally

25720|0x00248428|I ascended the stairway while paying the utmost attention to my~surroundings.
25721|0x00248480|I ascended the stairway while~paying the utmost attention to~my surroundings.
25722|0x002484DD|I'd be a laughing stock if I got caught by the security.
25723|0x00248520|I'd be a laughing stock if I~got caught by the security.
25724|0x00248568|Because I had a golden opportunity in front of me.

25726|0x002485E7|I simply couldn't let go of this perfect opportunity to ensure the~survival of the Astro Club.
25727|0x00248650|I simply couldn't let go of~this perfect opportunity to~ensure the survival of the~Astro Club.
25728|0x002486E7|I put some strength into my arm and pushed open the heavy metal door~that supposedly led to the rooftop.

25732|0x00248871|It was much cooler up here than it was at ground level.

25735|0x00248988|The countless stars in the sky~spilled forth their pale light.
25736|0x002489D6|I was enshrouded by a veil of dim darkness.

25738|0x00248A47|The scene unfolding before me was somehow otherworldly.
25739|0x00248A89|The scene unfolding before me~was somehow otherworldly.
25740|0x00248AD0|An unbroken view that didn't fall short of the one offered by the~lookout.
25741|0x00248B25|An unbroken view that didn't~fall short of the one offered~by the lookout.
25742|0x00248B7F|I could only imagine how absolutely fantastic it would be to go~stargazing here.

25744|0x00248C3A|I then made my way across the rooftop.

25746|0x00248CC9|Presumably having noticed my footsteps, the girl turned toward me.

25752|0x00248E6A|I approached her slowly.

25877|0x0024AE66|And that's perfectly fine. When~I don't make you an Astro Club~member, you'll then have to~join the Astro Club.
25878|0x0024AEF1|...Did you really not see how illogical that was when you said it?
25879|0x0024AF3E|...Did you really not see how~illogical that was when you~said it?
25880|0x0024AF90|I had to agree with her there.

25894|0x0024B291|What is it?
25895|0x0024B2A7|What is it?
25896|0x0024B2CE|I haven't told anyone what my wish is. Not even Suzuha.
25897|0x0024B310|I haven't told anyone what my~wish is. Not even Suzuha.

25900|0x0024B3F0|You're absolutely right.

25908|0x0024B57A|I couldn't help but agree with her.
25909|0x0024B5A8|I couldn't help but agree with~her.
25910|0x0024B5E5|Well, if I don't manage to fulfill it, you won't have to join the~Astro Club, so there's no negatives for you in accepting the deal, is~there?

25924|0x0024BA50|Supposing I pass up the deal, will you stop trying to get me into the~Astro Club?
25925|0x0024BAAC|Supposing I pass up the deal,~will you stop trying to get me~into the Astro Club?
25926|0x0024BB17|I'll definitely keep pestering you about it.

25940|0x0024BE43|Well, if we don't get another member by then, our club gets abolished.
25941|0x0024BE94|Well, if we don't get another~member by then, our club gets~abolished.
25942|0x0024BEF6|Even if you do find out what my wish is, I can't possibly see you~fulfilling it in a matter of five days.

26110|0x0024F17D|I didn't wish for a cold attitude that goes as cold as spitting,~Onii-chan!!
26111|0x0024F1D4|I didn't wish for a cold~attitude that goes as cold as~spitting, Onii-chan!!
26112|0x0024F230|Chinami then told me everything she knew about Aoi-san's past.
26113|0x0024F279|Chinami then told me everything~she knew about Aoi-san's past.
26114|0x0024F2C7|I was really thankful to my wonderful sister for doing all of this for~me.
26115|0x0024F31C|I was really thankful to my~wonderful sister for doing all~of this for me.
26116|0x0024F38C|While it is difficult to express my feelings with words and with my~attitude, in a way I do love her for being the way she is.
26117|0x0024F415|While it is difficult to~express my feelings with words~and with my attitude, in a way~I do love her for being the way
26118|0x0024F4A0|Chinami then told me everything she knows about Aoi-san's past.
26119|0x0024F4EA|Chinami then told me everything~she knows about Aoi-san's past.
26120|0x0024F539|I was really thankful to my wonderful sister for doing all of this for~me.
26121|0x0024F58E|I was really thankful to my~wonderful sister for doing all~of this for me.
26122|0x0024F5FE|Though, of course, I didn't sleep together with her.
26123|0x0024F63D|Though, of course, I didn't~sleep together with her.
26124|0x0024F703|Good morning, Asuho.
26125|0x0024F722|Good morning, Asuho.
26126|0x0024F780|Oh, You-chan. Make that two days in a row you're here early.
26127|0x0024F7C7|Oh, You-chan. Make that two~days in a row you're here~early.
26128|0x0024F81D|That's just how badly I miss you.
26129|0x0024F849|That's just how badly I miss~you.
26130|0x0024F87A|When I used the exact same line on Asuho that I used on Mare last~night, Asuho's cheeks turned bright red right away.
26131|0x0024F8FA|When I used the exact same line~on Asuho that I used on Mare~last night, Asuho's cheeks~turned bright red right away.
26132|0x0024F9B9|Eh? Uh, did you just...?
26133|0x0024F9DC|Eh? Uh, did you just...?
26134|0x0024FA0E|So, yeah, there's something I'd like to ask you.
26135|0x0024FA49|So, yeah, there's something I'd~like to ask you.
26136|0x0024FAA3|...You totally just brushed it off.
26137|0x0024FAD1|...You totally just brushed it~off.
26138|0x0024FB04|And then she went into dog mode.
26139|0x0024FB2F|And then she went into dog~mode.
26140|0x0024FB7C|Do you know about Hibarigasaki's Space Science Center?
26141|0x0024FBBD|Do you know about~Hibarigasaki's Space Science~Center?
26142|0x0024FC11|Asuho tilted her head curiously.
26143|0x0024FC3C|Asuho tilted her head~curiously.
26144|0x0024FC6C|This is one of the leads I received from Chinami last night.
26145|0x0024FCB3|This is one of the leads I~received from Chinami last~night.
26146|0x0024FCFF|Here in Hibarigasaki, they have a Science Center that's home to both a~planetarium and an observatory, as well as doing community events like~stargazing sessions at night.
26147|0x0024FDB5|Here in Hibarigasaki, they have~a Science Center that's home to~both a planetarium and an~observatory, as well as doing
26148|0x0024FE3C|The name of the building is the Hibarigasaki Space Science Center.
26149|0x0024FE89|The name of the building is the~Hibarigasaki Space Science~Center.
26150|0x0024FEDB|Chinami told me that Aoi-san used to frequent it in the past.
26151|0x0024FF23|Chinami told me that Aoi-san~used to frequent it in the~past.
26152|0x0024FF8A|The Space Science Center, huh? Boy, that sure takes me back.
26153|0x0024FFD1|The Space Science Center, huh?~Boy, that sure takes me back.
26154|0x00250027|I figured you would've been there before.
26155|0x0025005B|I figured you would've been~there before.
26156|0x002500AE|Only natural, yeah, as an astronomy fan.
26157|0x002500E1|Only natural, yeah, as an~astronomy fan.
26158|0x00250119|So Aoi-san was almost certainly an astronomy fan as well.
26159|0x0025015D|So Aoi-san was almost certainly~an astronomy fan as well.
26160|0x002501A6|But now she'd chosen to go stargazing on the rooftop instead.
26161|0x002501EE|But now she'd chosen to go~stargazing on the rooftop~instead.
26162|0x0025023B|I wanted to drop by the Space Science Center later, so I figured that~Asuho could tell me where it is.
26163|0x002502AC|I wanted to drop by the Space~Science Center later, so I~figured that Asuho could tell~me where it is.
26164|0x00250322|I felt certain that I would find a hint about Aoi-san's wish there...
26165|0x00250372|I felt certain that I would~find a hint about Aoi-san's~wish there...
26166|0x002503E1|It's a real shame they had to close it down, though.
26167|0x00250420|It's a real shame they had to~close it down, though.
26168|0x00250464|Asuho's words threw a wrench in my plans.
26169|0x00250498|Asuho's words threw a wrench in~my plans.
26170|0x002504DB|...What did you just say?
26171|0x002504FF|...What did you just say?
26172|0x00250542|I was just saying how much of a shame it is they had to close the~Space Science Center down.
26173|0x002505A9|I was just saying how much of a~shame it is they had to close~the Space Science Center down.
26174|0x0025061F|They... c-closed it down?
26175|0x00250643|They... c-closed it down?
26176|0x00250686|Oh, right. You already moved away by that time, so you don't know~about it.
26177|0x002506DC|Oh, right. You already moved~away by that time, so you don't~know about it.
26178|0x00250741|I didn't even know that Space Science Center existed before moving~away... Anyhow, they seriously closed it down?
26179|0x002507BD|I didn't even know that Space~Science Center existed before~moving away... Anyhow, they~seriously closed it down?
26180|0x00250858|Yeah. Must have been about four years ago now. I myself went to see~the planetarium's last screening, and wow, let me tell you, it was out~of this world.
26181|0x002508FC|Yeah. Must have been about four~years ago now. I myself went to~see the planetarium's last~screening, and wow, let me tell
26182|0x00250986|I clutched my head between my hands.
26183|0x002509B5|I clutched my head between my~hands.
26184|0x002509E9|...So that's why Aoi-san stopped going to the Space Science Center,~too.
26185|0x00250A3C|...So that's why Aoi-san~stopped going to the Space~Science Center, too.
26186|0x00250A94|Logically thinking, Asuho and the others would have been going there~instead of playing cards in the club room if that facility still~existed.
26187|0x00250B2D|Logically thinking, Asuho and~the others would have been~going there instead of playing~cards in the club room if that
26188|0x00250BBD|Have they torn down the building already?
26189|0x00250BF1|Have they torn down the~building already?
26190|0x00250C44|The building itself is still there, apparently. I think it's deserted~inside, though.
26191|0x00250CA4|The building itself is still~there, apparently. I think it's~deserted inside, though.
26192|0x00250D09|So going there would be a waste of time.
26193|0x00250D3C|So going there would be a waste~of time.
26194|0x00250D7E|But why did they close the place down in the first place?
26195|0x00250DC2|But why did they close the~place down in the first place?
26196|0x00250E25|Well, just circumstances in the world of adults, I guess is what you'd~chalk it up to. The place like just wasn't pulling in any money~anymore. Kids these days are more into video games than stars, you~know.
26197|0x00250EFF|Well, just circumstances in the~world of adults, I guess is~what you'd chalk it up to. The~place like just wasn't pulling
26198|0x00250F88|My newly found lead slipped through my hands in no time at all.
26199|0x00250FD2|My newly found lead slipped~through my hands in no time at~all.
26200|0x0025102B|Say, Asuho, would you mind telling me what you know about the science~center? Anything at all helps.
26201|0x0025109A|Say, Asuho, would you mind~telling me what you know about~the science center? Anything at~all helps.
26202|0x00251128|...You-chan, is something up?
26203|0x00251150|...You-chan, is something up?
26204|0x00251187|Well, like, apparently Aoi-san used to go to the place a ton in the~past, which is why I'm curious.
26205|0x002511F5|Well, like, apparently Aoi-san~used to go to the place a ton~in the past, which is why I'm~curious.
26206|0x00251282|Something to help get her into the club?
26207|0x002512B5|Something to help get her into~the club?
26208|0x002512F7|Yeah.
26209|0x00251307|Yeah.
26210|0x00251336|Do you need my help?
26211|0x00251355|Do you need my help?
26212|0x00251383|Yeah, you'd be a great help.
26213|0x002513AA|Yeah, you'd be a great help.
26214|0x002513D6|A brimming smile bloomed on her face.
26215|0x00251406|A brimming smile bloomed on her~face.
26216|0x00251455|If you wanna know all about the science center, I think your best~bet's to ask Okaizumi-senpai. He's much more familiar with it than me.
26217|0x002514E8|If you wanna know all about the~science center, I think your~best bet's to ask~Okaizumi-senpai. He's much more
26218|0x00251586|I mean, he used to be in the science center's Astronomy Club way back~in the day.
26219|0x002515E2|I mean, he used to be in the~science center's Astronomy Club~way back in the day.
26220|0x0025168F|The Space Science Center, huh? Boy, that sure takes me back.
26221|0x002516D6|The Space Science Center, huh?~Boy, that sure takes me back.
26222|0x00251722|Thus, having waited for the end of the school day to come, I went and~got hold of Okaizumi in the club room.
26223|0x00251799|Thus, having waited for the end~of the school day to come, I~went and got hold of Okaizumi~in the club room.
26224|0x00251874|When I got the news they were shutting the place down, that's when I~saw the Death-Omen Star up in the sky.
26225|0x002518EA|When I got the news they were~shutting the place down, that's~when I saw the Death-Omen Star~up in the sky.
26226|0x0025197F|From that point on, my memories are pretty vague, but I'm certain on~the day of the final screening, I gave a standing ovation and tossed~them a bouquet of flowers...
26227|0x00251A30|From that point on, my memories~are pretty vague, but I'm~certain on the day of the final~screening, I gave a standing
26228|0x00251AB6|The only thing I could really picture this guy doing was shouting out~protest chants.
26229|0x00251B16|The only thing I could really~picture this guy doing was~shouting out protest chants.
26230|0x00251BB0|You were in its Astronomy Club, right?
26231|0x00251BE1|You were in its Astronomy Club,~right?
26232|0x00251C4D|Did you not hear anything relating to the reason they decided to close~it down?
26233|0x00251CA7|Did you not hear anything~relating to the reason they~decided to close it down?
26234|0x00251D06|With regards to the facts and situation surrounding the now-gone~science center, both Asuho and Kosame-san told me they'd help out when~I explained the situation.
26235|0x00251DB3|With regards to the facts and~situation surrounding the~now-gone science center, both~Asuho and Kosame-san told me
26236|0x00251E35|All for the purpose of having Aoi-san join our club.
26237|0x00251E74|All for the purpose of having~Aoi-san join our club.
26238|0x00251EB8|So our Astro Club could live on.
26239|0x00251EE3|So our Astro Club could live~on.
26240|0x00251F5A|I haven't heard the reason they closed it down. It was a bolt from the~blue for me as well.
26241|0x00251FC0|I haven't heard the reason they~closed it down. It was a bolt~from the blue for me as well.
26242|0x00252045|Rumor says the director resigning had something to do with it, though.~If you believe that rumor, lack of a capable replacement might've been~the reason.
26243|0x002520E9|Rumor says the director~resigning had something to do~with it, though. If you believe~that rumor, lack of a capable
26244|0x00252186|Apparently, the director was a very charismatic person, so maybe the~staff also quit their jobs at the science center when he left.
26245|0x00252214|Apparently, the director was a~very charismatic person, so~maybe the staff also quit their~jobs at the science center when
26246|0x002522A8|Do you know who that director was?
26247|0x002522D5|Do you know who that director~was?
26248|0x00252321|Nope, not a clue. Heard he was renowned in the field of astronomy, but~at the time, I was more into the magical constellation myths rather~than the science behind them.
26249|0x002523D4|Nope, not a clue. Heard he was~renowned in the field of~astronomy, but at the time, I~was more into the magical
26250|0x0025249B|Did you learn about astronomical myths and legends in the Astronomy~Club you were a member in?
26251|0x00252504|Did you learn about~astronomical myths and legends~in the Astronomy Club you were~a member in?
26252|0x0025258C|Yep, we'd stargaze and learn about the corresponding myths as we did~it. Most members were young kids, so I can't blame their approach.
26253|0x0025261E|Yep, we'd stargaze and learn~about the corresponding myths~as we did it. Most members were~young kids, so I can't blame
26254|0x002526BF|Man, lucky you. I would've loved to be a part of that club, too.
26255|0x0025270A|Man, lucky you. I would've~loved to be a part of that~club, too.
26256|0x00252764|Why weren't you?
26257|0x0025277F|Why weren't you?
26258|0x002527B9|My dad just wouldn't have it. Nothing worse than parents that aren't~understanding of their kids.
26259|0x00252825|My dad just wouldn't have it.~Nothing worse than parents that~aren't understanding of their~kids.
26260|0x00252896|The way I see him, he is quite the understanding parent, actually.
26261|0x002528E3|The way I see him, he is quite~the understanding parent,~actually.
26262|0x00252975|So what's got you curious about the science center all of a sudden?
26263|0x002529C3|So what's got you curious about~the science center all of a~sudden?
26264|0x00252A20|See, actually, there's a student we want to have join the club, and~that girl used to frequent the science center apparently.
26265|0x00252AA8|See, actually, there's a~student we want to have join~the club, and that girl used to~frequent the science center
26266|0x00252B33|She's a first-year named Aoi Isuzu.
26267|0x00252B61|She's a first-year named Aoi~Isuzu.
26268|0x00252BA6|...Aoi Isuzu?
26269|0x00252BBE|...Aoi Isuzu?
26270|0x00252BDB|Okaizumi-senpai widened his eyes in surprise.
26271|0x00252C13|Okaizumi-senpai widened his~eyes in surprise.
26272|0x00252C84|Huh? Do you know her?
26273|0x00252CA4|Huh? Do you know her?
26274|0x00252CE9|I remember there being a girl with that exact same name in the~Astronomy Club. I thought it was quite the unusual name, but maybe~it's more common than I thought.
26275|0x00252D96|I remember there being a girl~with that exact same name in~the Astronomy Club. I thought~it was quite the unusual name,
26276|0x00252E27|...Err, are you sure it's not just the same person?
26277|0x00252E65|...Err, are you sure it's not~just the same person?
26278|0x00252EDD|How old was the girl you knew from back then?
26279|0x00252F15|How old was the girl you knew~from back then?
26280|0x00252F6C|Younger than me, pretty sure. Her attendance rate was really high, so~I remember her well.
26281|0x00252FD1|Younger than me, pretty sure.~Her attendance rate was really~high, so I remember her well.
26282|0x0025303B|There was no doubt we were talking about the same person.
26283|0x0025307F|There was no doubt we were~talking about the same person.
26284|0x002530C8|Just when this lead started to fizzle out on me, it came back into the~fore at the least expected moment.
26285|0x0025313C|Just when this lead started to~fizzle out on me, it came back~into the fore at the least~expected moment.
26286|0x002531E5|I'm guessing the Astronomy Club also disbanded because the science~center closed down?
26287|0x00253246|I'm guessing the Astronomy Club~also disbanded because the~science center closed down?
26288|0x002532C6|Yep. After all, we'd have no place to meet up at anymore. I came to~terms with it myself, but there's still no denying it left an empty~feeling behind.
26289|0x00253368|Yep. After all, we'd have no~place to meet up at anymore. I~came to terms with it myself,~but there's still no denying it
26290|0x002533F1|Okaizumi-senpai then got a distant look in his eyes. I had to wonder~if he was seeing the Death-Omen Star with those eyes.
26291|0x00253476|Okaizumi-senpai then got a~distant look in his eyes. I had~to wonder if he was seeing the~Death-Omen Star with those
26292|0x00253514|If this girl you're talking about really is Aoi-san, she just might~join our club.
26293|0x00253571|If this girl you're talking~about really is Aoi-san, she~just might join our club.
26294|0x002535DD|...That would be all fine and dandy if so, but it isn't going so well~honestly.
26295|0x00253637|...That would be all fine and~dandy if so, but it isn't going~so well honestly.
26296|0x002536B0|Did she lose interest in stargazing over time then, you think?
26297|0x002536F9|Did she lose interest in~stargazing over time then, you~think?
26298|0x00253747|I really wanted to believe that wasn't the case. Her going to the~rooftop with that telescope wouldn't make a shred of sense under that~assumption.
26299|0x002537E5|I really wanted to believe that~wasn't the case. Her going to~the rooftop with that telescope~wouldn't make a shred of sense
26300|0x0025387B|Senpai, do you know what it means to see the starry sky of the past?
26301|0x002538CA|Senpai, do you know what it~means to see the starry sky of~the past?
26302|0x00253938|...The starry sky of the past you say?
26303|0x00253969|...The starry sky of the past~you say?
26304|0x002539A9|Yeah. Aoi-san said she wants to see the starry sky of the past.
26305|0x002539F3|Yeah. Aoi-san said she wants to~see the starry sky of the past.
26306|0x00253A42|Okaizumi-senpai pondered the phrase.
26307|0x00253A71|Okaizumi-senpai pondered the~phrase.
26308|0x00253AE7|...Any ideas, Asuho-kun?
26309|0x00253B0A|...Any ideas, Asuho-kun?
26310|0x00253B4C|I've got nothing.
26311|0x00253B68|I've got nothing.
26312|0x00253B89|Asuho shrugged her shoulders.
26313|0x00253BB1|Asuho shrugged her shoulders.
26314|0x00253BF8|I mean, there isn't really any past when it comes to the stars.
26315|0x00253C42|I mean, there isn't really any~past when it comes to the~stars.
26316|0x00253C9B|...Huh? What do you mean by that?
26317|0x00253CC7|...Huh? What do you mean by~that?
26318|0x00253D30|You heard right. It's been around 13.7 billion years since the birth~of the universe in which you and I live. Over that span of time,~countless stars have been born and died.
26319|0x00253DE9|You heard right. It's been~around 13.7 billion years since~the birth of the universe in~which you and I live. Over that

26322|0x00253F93|So if we are to be absolutely precise, the starry sky does have a~past. Over long stretches of time, the patterns in the stars can~change a lot.

26326|0x00254200|And then, on top of that, how many years do you think Aoi-san's been~alive?
26327|0x00254256|And then, on top of that, how~many years do you think~Aoi-san's been alive?
26328|0x002542BB|...Well, less than twenty years anyway.
26329|0x002542ED|...Well, less than twenty years~anyway.
26330|0x0025433E|Compared to the history of our universe, that's just a blink of the~eye. So how much change do you reckon the starry sky would go through~in that time frame?
26331|0x002543E6|Compared to the history of our~universe, that's just a blink~of the eye. So how much change~do you reckon the starry sky

26333|0x002544C5|Practically none at all.
26334|0x00254507|At the very least, no sort of change that we'd see in the~constellations. So that's why we say that, to us humans, the starry~sky essentially has no past.

26406|0x00256002|Most likely, yeah.

26431|0x00256972|Hold on, hold on. Is a~planetarium that easy to make?
26432|0x002569E6|Of course it isn't. We made one as our club's exhibition for the~school festival last year, and I think that took us about a whole two~weeks.

26452|0x0025736F|I don't believe that would be very feasible of an idea. The reason~being, the fact doesn't change that it would still take us working on~it through several nights to complete it on time.

26472|0x00257E08|So to sum up what we have so far, we require a place within the~perimeters of school with enough space to hold a planetarium, that~also is enough out of people's eye that we won't get caught...

26519|0x00259088|The rooftop. There's more than~enough space there, plus~there's a slim chance of anyone~stumbling upon us there, right?
26520|0x00259148|True that. For one, the security doesn't go there on their patrol.
26521|0x00259195|True that. For one, the~security doesn't go there on~their patrol.
26522|0x00259201|Well, since the door there is locked, I don't think we'll have to~worry about anyone coming, but well...
26523|0x00259274|Well, since the door there is~locked, I don't think we'll~have to worry about anyone~coming, but well...
26524|0x00259325|The fact is we, too, can't go up there.
26525|0x00259357|The fact is we, too, can't go~up there.
26526|0x00259398|...So on top of the rooftop being off-limits, they even lock the door?
26527|0x002593E9|...So on top of the rooftop~being off-limits, they even~lock the door?
26528|0x00259459|Yeah. It's because stupid Komomo-chan won't lend us the key that we~couldn't do any stargazing there even on Tanabata.
26529|0x002594DA|Yeah. It's because stupid~Komomo-chan won't lend us the~key that we couldn't do any~stargazing there even on
26530|0x00259556|Come to think of it, I did overhear that conversation.
26531|0x00259597|Come to think of it, I did~overhear that conversation.
26532|0x002595E7|But that's weird. I went up to the rooftop just fine.
26533|0x00259627|But that's weird. I went up to~the rooftop just fine.
26534|0x00259696|All three of them shot me a puzzled look.
26535|0x002596CA|All three of them shot me a~puzzled look.
26536|0x0025970D|Just last night, I went up there and met Aoi-san.
26537|0x00259749|Just last night, I went up~there and met Aoi-san.
26538|0x00259796|...Huh? How?
26539|0x002597AD|...Huh? How?
26540|0x002597D3|Well, the door just opened when I pulled. Wasn't locked or anything.
26541|0x00259822|Well, the door just opened when~I pulled. Wasn't locked or~anything.
26542|0x00259890|Do you think they're leaving it unlocked now?
26543|0x002598C8|Do you think they're leaving it~unlocked now?
26544|0x0025991F|I don't think so... There's no way Nee-san would allow something like~that.
26545|0x00259975|I don't think so... There's no~way Nee-san would allow~something like that.
26546|0x002599EA|Then why was it unlocked?
26547|0x00259A0E|Then why was it unlocked?
26548|0x00259A37|There was only one possibility.
26549|0x00259A61|There was only one possibility.
26550|0x00259A9A|Aoi-san must have a key to the rooftop...
26551|0x00259ACE|Aoi-san must have a key to the~rooftop...
26552|0x00259B21|Wh-Why?
26553|0x00259B33|Wh-Why?
26554|0x00259B64|Is Aoi-san not a Student Council member herself? If she was, she would~be able to easily borrow the key from the faculty room.
26555|0x00259BED|Is Aoi-san not a Student~Council member herself? If she~was, she would be able to~easily borrow the key from the
26556|0x00259C77|I don't think she is. When she and Hisakaki talked during the bag~searches the other day, it seemed like that was their first time~meeting.
26557|0x00259D0D|I don't think she is. When she~and Hisakaki talked during the~bag searches the other day, it~seemed like that was their
26558|0x00259DAE|So she just takes it without permission?
26559|0x00259DE1|So she just takes it without~permission?
26560|0x00259E33|There's no way for us to tell, but either way, that just might be a~windfall for us.
26561|0x00259E92|There's no way for us to tell,~but either way, that just might~be a windfall for us.
26562|0x00259EF6|He was right.
26563|0x00259F0E|He was right.
26564|0x00259F2B|The rooftop is usually locked, so no one goes there.
26565|0x00259F6A|The rooftop is usually locked,~so no one goes there.
26566|0x00259FAE|Not even the security does. After all, there is no need to check the~rooftop if it is locked anyway.
26567|0x0025A01D|Not even the security does.~After all, there is no need to~check the rooftop if it is~locked anyway.
26568|0x0025A091|If Aoi-san had a key, we could use that to our advantage.
26569|0x0025A0D5|If Aoi-san had a key, we could~use that to our advantage.
26570|0x0025A138|If there were one problem, though, it'd be the fact that we're limited~to using the rooftop only during nighttime.
26571|0x0025A1B5|If there were one problem,~though, it'd be the fact that~we're limited to using the~rooftop only during nighttime.
26572|0x0025A241|...How come?
26573|0x0025A258|...How come?
26574|0x0025A28E|Well, if we assemble a planetarium there in broad daylight, it'll be~clearly visible to others, right?
26575|0x0025A2FF|Well, if we assemble a~planetarium there in broad~daylight, it'll be clearly~visible to others, right?
26576|0x0025A38F|Indeed, taking into consideration the planetarium's height, it would~be in plain sight from the schoolyard and sports grounds.

26581|0x0025A638|Which means our only shot is to~assemble the whole thing within~a single night.
26582|0x0025A6A1|...Err, does that mean it all comes down to one night which will make~or break us?
26583|0x0025A6FE|...Err, does that mean it all~comes down to one night which~will make or break us?
26584|0x0025A77A|Now you're on the same page, You-chan!

26586|0x0025A7E1|How could she just be so nonchalant about all of this?
26587|0x0025A822|How could she just be so~nonchalant about all of this?
26588|0x0025A8BA|We'll get started this coming night, and complete the planetarium by~tomorrow morning!

26598|0x0025ABD3|Yet even despite all of that, there was still no guarantee we'd even~make it in time.

26730|0x0025CCC1|That has nothing to do with you.

27457|0x0026B896|I really wish she'd keep that~last part figurative.
27458|0x0026B8F3|Besides, Komomo-chan can't sneer at us anymore, not to mention I can~brag all I want to Asuka-kun now.

27461|0x0026BA29|It was almost like the perks~she listed were all totally~irrelevant.
27462|0x0026BA87|But, wouldn't you rather go stargazing with the whole club?

27464|0x0026BB32|Well, yeah, but...

27466|0x0026BB71|Asuho wasn't quite making herself clear.
27467|0x0026BBA4|Asuho wasn't quite making~herself clear.
27468|0x0026BBE6|Don't you feel even a teensy bit glad? I mean, you threw your back~into recruitment that much.
27469|0x0026BC4F|Don't you feel even a teensy~bit glad? I mean, you threw~your back into recruitment that~much.
27470|0x0026BCD7|Of course, I'm jumping for joy. The Astro Club will last on now, and~nothing's better than that.
27471|0x0026BD42|Of course, I'm jumping for joy.~The Astro Club will last on~now, and nothing's better than~that.
27472|0x0026BDCC|I don't have to live with knowing it died out in my generation.
27473|0x0026BE16|I don't have to live with~knowing it died out in my~generation.
27474|0x0026BE65|Asuho said that, but then she nearly contradicted herself when she~said...
27475|0x0026BEBA|Asuho said that, but then she~nearly contradicted herself~when she said...
27476|0x0026BF2E|In the end, that might not matter so much, since just having the~starry sky over my head is good enough for me.
27477|0x0026BFA8|In the end, that might not~matter so much, since just~having the starry sky over my~head is good enough for me.
27478|0x0026C041|Maybe all I need is someone to stand by my side and gaze up at the~stars with me.
27479|0x0026C09D|Maybe all I need is someone to~stand by my side and gaze up at~the stars with me.
27480|0x0026C0FE|Asuho squinted at the sky like she was searching for the stars that~were still not out yet.
27481|0x0026C164|Asuho squinted at the sky like~she was searching for the stars~that were still not out yet.
27482|0x0026C1D9|Man, what a self-centered vice prez we have.
27483|0x0026C210|Man, what a self-centered vice~prez we have.
27484|0x0026C266|That's right. So you better keep that a secret between the two of us.
27485|0x0026C2B6|That's right. So you better~keep that a secret between the~two of us.
27486|0x0026C325|It'll be our little secret.
27487|0x0026C34B|It'll be our little secret.

27492|0x0026C46C|...So not tonight, but soon.
27493|0x0026C493|...So not tonight, but soon.
27494|0x0026C4C9|I'll try my hand with Hisakaki and see if I can do anything. Even if~we won't be a club officially until next semester, she might lend us~the rooftop key ahead of time.

27501|0x0026C6A4|I'm not a dog!
27502|0x0026C6CC|Come to think of it, there is one attendance day in summer break,~right? The 10th of August, if I remember right.
27503|0x0026C748|Come to think of it, there is~one attendance day in summer~break, right? The 10th of~August, if I remember right.
27504|0x0026C7E3|Yep. Pretty sure it's a Friday.
27505|0x0026C80D|Yep. Pretty sure it's a Friday.
27506|0x0026C846|I'll see if they can't hold their meeting concerning clubs on that~day.
27507|0x0026C898|I'll see if they can't hold~their meeting concerning clubs~on that day.
27508|0x0026C909|...You're pretty enthusiastic about all this.

27514|0x0026CA28|The fact that she was in dog mode was proof enough of that though,~honestly.
27515|0x0026CA7F|The fact that she was in dog~mode was proof enough of that~though, honestly.
27516|0x0026CAE5|Anyhow, I'll see what I can do so we can maybe do some club stargazing~over the break.

27520|0x0026CC3F|Oh, I have a reason for that.
27521|0x0026CC67|Oh, I have a reason for that.
27522|0x0026CCAE|What is it?
27523|0x0026CCC4|What is it?
27524|0x0026CCE9|It's because I love the stars.
27525|0x0026CD12|It's because I love the stars.
27526|0x0026CD40|Because I wanted to stargaze together with Aoi-san and Mare, too, not~just Asuho.
27527|0x0026CD9C|Because I wanted to stargaze~together with Aoi-san and Mare,~too, not just Asuho.
27528|0x0026CE07|From my perspective, you're the one acting a little off. Ever since we~avoided abolishment, really.

27530|0x0026CF02|...Ahaha.
27531|0x0026CF16|...Ahaha.
27532|0x0026CF2F|I didn't quite understand the meaning behind her laughter.
27533|0x0026CF74|I didn't quite understand the~meaning behind her laughter.
27534|0x0026CFD8|Well, you see... How should I say it, I was just like...
27535|0x0026D01B|Well, you see... How should I~say it, I was just like...
27536|0x0026D063|After a moment of hesitation, she went on.
27537|0x0026D098|After a moment of hesitation,~she went on.
27538|0x0026D0EC|Getting the thought that, like, maybe you hate stargazing alone with~me...
27539|0x0026D141|Getting the thought that, like,~maybe you hate stargazing alone~with me...
27540|0x0026D19B|Asuho continued before I could reply with anything.
27541|0x0026D1D9|Asuho continued before I could~reply with anything.
27542|0x0026D236|Ahaha, don't mind me. I didn't mean it like that.
27543|0x0026D272|Ahaha, don't mind me. I didn't~mean it like that.
27544|0x0026D2B3|Asuho waved her hand, as if to dismiss her own worries.
27545|0x0026D2F5|Asuho waved her hand, as if to~dismiss her own worries.
27546|0x0026D356|If we actually can do club stuff over the course of our summer break,~I'd like to do stargazing with the others, too.

27549|0x0026D4B7|It felt like she forcibly~changed the topic back to what~we were talking about before.
27550|0x0026D537|Just, well, I don't think you're gonna have an easy time. This is~Komomo-chan we're talking about, after all.
27551|0x0026D5AF|Just, well, I don't think~you're gonna have an easy time.~This is Komomo-chan we're~talking about, after all.
27552|0x0026D636|Well, if worse comes to worst, we can always just use Aoi-san's key.
27553|0x0026D685|Well, if worse comes to worst,~we can always just use~Aoi-san's key.
27554|0x0026D6F3|I've kinda been wondering why she has that key in the first place.
27555|0x0026D740|I've kinda been wondering why~she has that key in the first~place.
27556|0x0026D79C|I'll ask her as soon as I get the chance, but I don't really get the~feeling it's something she borrowed from the school.
27557|0x0026D820|I'll ask her as soon as I get~the chance, but I don't really~get the feeling it's something~she borrowed from the school.
27558|0x0026D8C3|Yeah, I know what you mean. No way a normal student'd be able to get~permission to borrow it for an indefinite amount of time.
27559|0x0026D94C|Yeah, I know what you mean. No~way a normal student'd be able~to get permission to borrow it~for an indefinite amount of

27564|0x0026DC0D|It'd be no different than the idea I previously suggested of covertly~using the lookout.
27565|0x0026DC70|It'd be no different than the~idea I previously suggested of~covertly using the lookout.
27566|0x0026DCE2|At the end of the day, I guess it does all come down to Hisakaki.
27567|0x0026DD2E|At the end of the day, I guess~it does all come down to~Hisakaki.
27568|0x0026DD7F|Although the idea of piling on more debt didn't quite sit well with me~considering I hadn't paid her back for what I already owed her.

27582|0x0026E165|Yeah, of course.
27583|0x0026E180|Yeah, of course.
27584|0x0026E1A0|I could've taken the chance to enjoy Asuho's home cooking again.

27586|0x0026E245|I'd love to take you up on that, but...
27587|0x0026E277|I'd love to take you up on~that, but...
27588|0x0026E2AE|I did feel bad for turning her down, but different from before, this~time we had remedial classes, so there was no way she pulled another~all-nighter making a dish for me.
27589|0x0026E364|I did feel bad for turning her~down, but different from~before, this time we had~remedial classes, so there was
27590|0x0026E3E3|Or rather, I honestly didn't want to believe that she did that.

27594|0x0026E4E3|Chinami's waiting inside, probably famished.
27595|0x0026E51A|Chinami's waiting inside,~probably famished.
27596|0x0026E570|Then just bring her along.
27597|0x0026E595|Then just bring her along.
27598|0x0026E5BF|That would directly chain into Chinami helping me with work at the~cafe today, which I'd rather not deal with.

27600|0x0026E6C0|Sorry, but I'll pass today.

27615|0x0026E9B6|All right, I'll be at the cafe~then.
27616|0x0026EA03|Back in good spirits at the end, Asuho walked off home.
27617|0x0026EA45|Back in good spirits at the~end, Asuho walked off home.
27618|0x0026EA8C|I was starting to feel bad about turning her down so often, so I~decided to make something for lunch ahead of time before heading to my~remedial classes tomorrow.

27931|0x00274E6F|She continued on, pointing at~me.

27954|0x00275335|I felt terribly restless.

27957|0x002753A4|(What is this feeling?)
27958|0x002753CB|I felt something throbbing.

27972|0x00275728|Inevitably so, I ended up calling out to the woman.

27974|0x002757D8|Do you need a hand with that?
27975|0x00275800|Do you need a hand with that?
27976|0x0027582D|Still gripping the handles, the woman turned her head towards me.
27977|0x00275879|Still gripping the handles, the~woman turned her head towards~me.
27978|0x002758CA|At first glance, she was probably around the same age as Shino-san.
27979|0x00275918|At first glance, she was~probably around the same age as~Shino-san.
27980|0x0027596B|Though, unlike Shino-san, she gave off a brisk, strong-willed sort of~vibe.

27982|0x00275A4C|Sure, thanks. Could I get you to push the scooter from the back then?

27984|0x00275AFB|Absolutely.

27988|0x00275C27|It was heavier than I expected it to be. Maybe she had some stuff~stored beneath the seat or something.

28012|0x002764AF|I got scolded.
28013|0x002764C8|I got scolded.
28014|0x002764F4|So how are you liking the town so far? I imagine it's pretty difficult~getting used to this place if you've lived somewhere else.

28020|0x00276763|Is it?
28021|0x00276774|Is it?
28022|0x002767A6|Well, it's normal for people to move away from here because they got~sick of the inconvenient environment. You wouldn't expect anyone to~come back.
28023|0x00276844|Well, it's normal for people to~move away from here because~they got sick of the~inconvenient environment. You
28024|0x002768CC|Well, that is kind of depressing.

28028|0x002769BC|Yeah, I do.
28029|0x002769D2|Yeah, I do.

28031|0x00276A77|Oh, an honest answer. With kids~like you around, maybe this~town's not completely screwed~just yet.
28032|0x00276AEA|As we chatted along like that, I remembered one thing I'd forgotten to~ask her.
28033|0x00276B44|As we chatted along like that,~I remembered one thing I'd~forgotten to ask her.
28034|0x00276BAD|By the way, how far do you want me to help push the scooter?

28036|0x00276C5C|I hate to ask you this, but all the way to my place if you don't mind.

28038|0x00276D0D|And where is that?
28039|0x00276D2A|And where is that?
28040|0x00276D5A|In the neighboring town.
28041|0x00276D7D|In the neighboring town.
28042|0x00276DA5|Here I was sure that she was a Hibarigasaki resident, but it turned~out that she wasn't.

28044|0x00276E70|The neighboring town is past the waterway.
28045|0x00276EA5|The neighboring town is past~the waterway.
28046|0x00276EDF|While it isn't much of a distance to get there, the town itself covers~a wide area, being more of an urban city than Hibarigasaki.

28048|0x00276FEB|The fact that she'd come here on a scooter made a wave of anxiety wash~over me.
28049|0x00277045|The fact that she'd come here~on a scooter made a wave of~anxiety wash over me.
28050|0x002770C0|You're much younger than me, so I gotta rely on that energy of yours~to help me out here.
28051|0x00277124|You're much younger than me, so~I gotta rely on that energy of~yours to help me out here.
28052|0x0027718D|I felt like those words were the preface to everything that was laying~in store for me.
28053|0x002771EF|I felt like those words were~the preface to everything that~was laying in store for me.
28054|0x00277291|Thereupon, we spent an entire hour pushing the scooter to her place.
28055|0x002772E0|Thereupon, we spent an entire~hour pushing the scooter to her~place.
28056|0x00277334|I guess that wouldn't have been too bad if the weather was nice and~cool, but being in the middle of summer as we were, my stamina got~considerably depleted.

28059|0x002774D2|I'll go put the scooter in our~garage, so wait a moment. I~still want to thank you.
28060|0x00277535|Taking into account the fact that she was the one with more energy~after this trip, it's not hard to imagine that she could've pushed it~all this way without help.
28061|0x002775E3|Taking into account the fact~that she was the one with more~energy after this trip, it's~not hard to imagine that she

28063|0x002776A4|I sat down on the stone steps~to catch my breath.
28064|0x00277703|Anyhow, her home actually turned out to be a shrine, much to my~surprise.
28065|0x00277757|Anyhow, her home actually~turned out to be a shrine, much~to my surprise.
28066|0x002777B0|I was even less knowledgeable about the topography here than in~Hibarigasaki. I wasn't even aware the neighboring town held a shrine~to begin with.

28070|0x00277972|I'd never heard of the name before, so I figured the deity enshrined~here was some relatively unknown, local one.

28074|0x00277AE6|I strolled through the shrine grounds in search of a shady area.
28075|0x00277B31|I strolled through the shrine~grounds in search of a shady~area.
28076|0x00277B81|Thanks to all the foliage around, there was also a deafening chorus of~cicadas.

28078|0x00277C3A|While covering one of my ears, I gave Asuho a call, telling her I'd be~late for work.

28082|0x00277DBC|Incidentally, we made a group chat for the Astro Club on the day of~the closing ceremony, so I also had everyone's numbers registered in~my cellphone's address book.

28087|0x0027801E|On top of that, she even said~she was proud of me for helping~out.
28088|0x00278070|I dunno whether it's the fact that she's my senior at work that makes~her act like that or what, but every once in a while Asuho will get~that urge to act like she's my big sister or something.
28089|0x0027813C|I dunno whether it's the fact~that she's my senior at work~that makes her act like that or~what, but every once in a while

28152|0x0027940B|She really takes after her mother when it comes to that strong-willed~nature.
28153|0x00279463|She really takes after her~mother when it comes to that~strong-willed nature.
28154|0x002794C0|Which means that lady is Kosame-san's mother as well, but maybe~Kosame-san takes more after her father personality-wise.

28190|0x0027A186|Then I'll take you up on that.

28227|0x0027AB99|Hisakaki didn't answer me.

28230|0x0027ACB5|What the heck was that for?!

28233|0x0027AD63|Stop asking questions and hurry~up and get the new water.
28234|0x0027ADB6|You're the one who asked me a question right when I was about to go!

28250|0x0027B279|Sorry you got dragged into helping Komomo.
28251|0x0027B2AE|Sorry you got dragged into~helping Komomo.
28252|0x0027B2E8|Apparently their mother's name is Mayaka. She hadn't told me her name~on the way here.
28253|0x0027B349|Apparently their mother's name~is Mayaka. She hadn't told me~her name on the way here.

28263|0x0027B6AC|Well, you did say she wanted to~thank you.
28264|0x0027B6E6|Hisakaki had changed into a more casual outfit, meaning her work was~done for the day.
28265|0x0027B747|Hisakaki had changed into a~more casual outfit, meaning her~work was done for the day.
28266|0x0027B7C7|I'm going to cool off here until the AC in my room's done its job.
28267|0x0027B814|I'm going to cool off here~until the AC in my room's done~its job.
28268|0x0027B866|She sat down on the floor cushion right across me.
28269|0x0027B8A3|She sat down on the floor~cushion right across me.
28270|0x0027B8EF|But really, I never would've guessed you didn't actually live in~Hibarigasaki.
28271|0x0027B948|But really, I never would've~guessed you didn't actually~live in Hibarigasaki.
28272|0x0027B9C0|Yeah, well obviously. I wouldn't commute to school by train otherwise.
28273|0x0027BA11|Yeah, well obviously. I~wouldn't commute to school by~train otherwise.
28274|0x0027BA81|Then again, the place around here might as well be considered an~extended area of Hibarigasaki. The look and atmosphere are essentially~the same.
28275|0x0027BB1D|Then again, the place around~here might as well be~considered an extended area of~Hibarigasaki. The look and
28276|0x0027BB99|The neighboring town could well be called an urban city, but since the~area where this shrine is located in is the outskirts, it's less~bustling and more tranquil.
28277|0x0027BC47|The neighboring town could well~be called an urban city, but~since the area where this~shrine is located in is the
28278|0x0027BCD3|This place isn't too far out, so why don't you just use a scooter like~Mayaka-san?
28279|0x0027BD30|This place isn't too far out,~so why don't you just use a~scooter like Mayaka-san?
28280|0x0027BDAC|Hibari High bans commuting to school by both scooter and bicycle.~Considering the slope of Yumemi Hill, I can hardly blame them for it.
28281|0x0027BE3E|Hibari High bans commuting to~school by both scooter and~bicycle. Considering the slope~of Yumemi Hill, I can hardly
28282|0x0027BECC|Well, yeah, I guess it'd be pretty hellish trying to climb that hill~with a bicycle.
28283|0x0027BF2B|Well, yeah, I guess it'd be~pretty hellish trying to climb~that hill with a bicycle.
28284|0x0027BF8F|A shame, though. I have a scooter license, so commuting to school by~scooter does seem rather appealing to me, honestly.

28286|0x0027C0AA|They could do a lot of good just by adding at least a bus stop in~front of school, really.
28287|0x0027C10F|They could do a lot of good~just by adding at least a bus~stop in front of school,~really.
28288|0x0027C183|Yeah, I guess. But even if a bus was running there, I doubt anyone but~students would ever use it.
28289|0x0027C1F0|Yeah, I guess. But even if a~bus was running there, I doubt~anyone but students would ever~use it.
28290|0x0027C27C|The only nearby tourist attraction is the lookout, which as we know is~off-limits, so yeah, you have a point.
28291|0x0027C2F4|The only nearby tourist~attraction is the lookout,~which as we know is off-limits,~so yeah, you have a point.
28292|0x0027C38B|I'm just saying it wouldn't be so bad if the weather was nice, but~climbing that hill in this stuffy heat is just, ugh...
28293|0x0027C40F|I'm just saying it wouldn't be~so bad if the weather was nice,~but climbing that hill in this~stuffy heat is just, ugh...
28294|0x0027C4A2|I know how you feel. Just thinking ahead to Attendance Day makes me~want to cry.

28302|0x0027C6E8|Would that be possible, or not?
28303|0x0027C712|Would that be possible, or not?
28304|0x0027C75B|Well, I guess it is technically possible... but honestly I'm getting~bad vibes about where this is going.
28305|0x0027C7CF|Well, I guess it is technically~possible... but honestly I'm~getting bad vibes about where~this is going.
28306|0x0027C852|I always know I can count on you. You catch on so quick I don't even~have to say anything.

28310|0x0027C9B4|It was honestly problematic how fast she caught on.
28311|0x0027C9F2|It was honestly problematic how~fast she caught on.
28312|0x0027CA4F|It's probably just something related to your little Astro Club, no?
28313|0x0027CA9D|It's probably just something~related to your little Astro~Club, no?
28314|0x0027CAFA|Right.

28320|0x0027CC87|She heaved a heavy sigh.
28321|0x0027CCAA|She heaved a heavy sigh.

28337|0x0027D1D1|Which is why I'm asking you to~deal with it on Attendance Day.
28338|0x0027D239|The Astro Club will be officially recognized as a club when we hold~the meeting concerning extracurriculars. And that meeting will be held~in the second term. The situation seems more than clear to me.
28339|0x0027D30D|The Astro Club will be~officially recognized as a club~when we hold the meeting~concerning extracurriculars.
28340|0x0027D393|Come on. Just a provisional permit to use the rooftop is all I'm~asking for.

28355|0x0027D88E|Okay. Then take care of~sprinkling and sweeping the~shrine grounds.
28356|0x0027D8EB|Already did the water sprinkling, so I guess that just leaves~sweeping.

28369|0x0027DCA8|Hey! Why are you just giving me~a straight answer now when~you've been turning me down all~this time?!
28370|0x0027DD28|Admittedly, I'm honestly not cut out for that job. That's the only~reason I've been turning you down.
28371|0x0027DD98|Admittedly, I'm honestly not~cut out for that job. That's~the only reason I've been~turning you down.
28372|0x0027DE17|However, if you go along with this, I wouldn't mind putting my back~into the Student Council in return.
28373|0x0027DE89|However, if you go along with~this, I wouldn't mind putting~my back into the Student~Council in return.
28374|0x0027DF1A|...Is the Astro Club that important to you?

28376|0x0027DF95|Yeah.
28377|0x0027DFA5|Yeah.
28378|0x0027DFD4|You seriously can't wait until the second term?
28379|0x0027E00E|You seriously can't wait until~the second term?
28380|0x0027E057|Seriously can't.
28381|0x0027E072|Seriously can't.
28382|0x0027E09E|Why?
28383|0x0027E0AD|Why?
28384|0x0027E0CB|There's plenty of reasons, but well, I don't really want to say them.
28385|0x0027E11B|There's plenty of reasons, but~well, I don't really want to~say them.

28388|0x0027E1CC|She rudely persisted in her questioning.
28389|0x0027E1FF|She rudely persisted in her~questioning.
28390|0x0027E237|Telling her my reasons would require explaining about Mare.
28391|0x0027E27D|Telling her my reasons would~require explaining about Mare.
28392|0x0027E2C8|And my biggest reason would involve explaining about even the girl~from the lookout.
28393|0x0027E327|And my biggest reason would~involve explaining about even~the girl from the lookout.
28394|0x0027E38B|It wasn't hard to imagine the kind of ridicule I'd get from her.
28395|0x0027E3D6|It wasn't hard to imagine the~kind of ridicule I'd get from~her.
28396|0x0027E440|Well, can't really go giving you permission if you're just gonna use~it for dubious purposes.
28397|0x0027E4A8|Well, can't really go giving~you permission if you're just~gonna use it for dubious~purposes.

28404|0x0027E6AA|Nee-san, it's not polite to pry.
28405|0x0027E6D5|Nee-san, it's not polite to~pry.

28420|0x0027EB8D|Mayaka-san went around handing out barley tea.
28421|0x0027EBC6|Mayaka-san went around handing~out barley tea.
28422|0x0027EC1E|Wait, I gave Kosame the last one. I don't have one for myself anymore.
28423|0x0027EC6F|Wait, I gave Kosame the last~one. I don't have one for~myself anymore.
28424|0x0027ECF9|I'll go get an extra cup then.
28425|0x0027ED22|I'll go get an extra cup then.
28426|0x0027ED74|As Kosame-san disappeared into the kitchen, Mayaka-san sat down where~she'd been sitting.

28432|0x0027EFC3|Oh, I guess I never did tell you.

28438|0x0027F1A8|Hisakaki almost dropped the cup in her hands.
28439|0x0027F1E0|Hisakaki almost dropped the cup~in her hands.
28440|0x0027F23D|R-Really?
28441|0x0027F251|R-Really?
28442|0x0027F284|Really. Since our shrine worships the August Star of Heaven, it should~hardly be a surprise that a shrine heiress like myself has an interest~in stargazing.
28443|0x0027F32B|Really. Since our shrine~worships the August Star of~Heaven, it should hardly be a~surprise that a shrine heiress
28444|0x0027F3AC|I suppose this August Star of Heaven must be the name of a local~deity.
28445|0x0027F3FE|I suppose this August Star of~Heaven must be the name of a~local deity.
28446|0x0027F46F|Actually, your distaste for the stars is really the more odd thing.
28447|0x0027F4BD|Actually, your distaste for the~stars is really the more odd~thing.
28448|0x0027F52A|...Hmph.
28449|0x0027F53D|...Hmph.
28450|0x0027F56F|Kogasaka-kun, is it? I'm kinda curious, did the Astronomy Club's name~change to Astro Club now?
28451|0x0027F5D9|Kogasaka-kun, is it? I'm kinda~curious, did the Astronomy~Club's name change to Astro~Club now?
28452|0x0027F652|Ah, yes. It was downgraded to an unofficial group because there~weren't enough members around anymore.
28453|0x0027F6C3|Ah, yes. It was downgraded to~an unofficial group because~there weren't enough members~around anymore.
28454|0x0027F76E|But now it has been recognized as a club again.

28461|0x0027F93D|What are you saying? You also~helped with that.
28462|0x0027F996|Which means the two of you are Astro Club members. Is it fun?
28463|0x0027F9DE|Which means the two of you are~Astro Club members. Is it fun?
28464|0x0027FA45|It used to be fun already, but now it promises to become even more so.

28467|0x0027FB42|Yeah. Our real activities as a~club will be starting from now~on.
28468|0x0027FBAD|Sure smells like youth.

28470|0x0027FC02|......
28471|0x0027FC13|......
28472|0x0027FC43|What are you pouting for? You should just join them, too.
28473|0x0027FC87|What are you pouting for? You~should just join them, too.
28474|0x0027FCEA|...Funny joke. Having to work as a shrine maiden is already annoying~enough.
28475|0x0027FD41|...Funny joke. Having to work~as a shrine maiden is already~annoying enough.
28476|0x0027FD9D|Hisakaki got up to leave.

28481|0x0027FEC2|Yeah. I'll just do my homework~or something.
28482|0x0027FF28|Doing homework this early in the morning? Have some fun or something,~you party-pooper.
28483|0x0027FF8A|Doing homework this early in~the morning? Have some fun or~something, you party-pooper.
28484|0x0028000B|I'm just doing the smart thing and avoiding procrastinating.
28485|0x00280052|I'm just doing the smart thing~and avoiding procrastinating.
28486|0x002800B8|You know, kid, all that studying won't do you a lick of good when you~actually get a real job.
28487|0x00280121|You know, kid, all that~studying won't do you a lick of~good when you actually get a~real job.
28488|0x002801A9|Implying I'm going to end up like you.
28489|0x002801DA|Implying I'm going to end up~like you.
28490|0x0028022A|The thing is, you're technically a heiress candidate for this shrine,~you know.
28491|0x00280284|The thing is, you're~technically a heiress candidate~for this shrine, you know.
28492|0x002802FD|Like I have any intention of doing that.
28493|0x00280330|Like I have any intention of~doing that.
28494|0x00280382|Man, you could at least lighten up a little bit, you know.
28495|0x002803C7|Man, you could at least lighten~up a little bit, you know.
28496|0x0028042B|Well, I don't have any obligation to succeed the shrine just because~I'm the oldest daughter.
28497|0x00280493|Well, I don't have any~obligation to succeed the~shrine just because I'm the~oldest daughter.
28498|0x0028051A|That's not what I'm talking about. I meant your attitude towards our~little guest here.
28499|0x0028057C|That's not what I'm talking~about. I meant your attitude~towards our little guest here.
28500|0x002805FD|You're the one who brought him here, so that's none of my concern.
28501|0x0028064A|You're the one who brought him~here, so that's none of my~concern.
28502|0x002806B6|Kogasaka-kun, wanna see our album of Komomo's every secret?
28503|0x002806FC|Kogasaka-kun, wanna see our~album of Komomo's every secret?
28504|0x00280776|What the hell is that?!
28505|0x00280798|What the hell is that?!
28506|0x002807D9|Just a normal family album.
28507|0x002807FF|Just a normal family album.
28508|0x00280844|And why do you need to show him that?!
28509|0x00280875|And why do you need to show him~that?!
28510|0x002808C5|Just thought maybe we could liven things up by talking about you.
28511|0x00280911|Just thought maybe we could~liven things up by talking~about you.
28512|0x0028097C|Look, I just said I don't have anything to do with this!
28513|0x002809BF|Look, I just said I don't have~anything to do with this!
28514|0x00280A45|Kogasaka-san, this is a photo of Nee-san taken during last year's~summer festival, where she...
28515|0x00280AAF|Kogasaka-san, this is a photo~of Nee-san taken during last~year's summer festival, where~she...
28516|0x00280B38|Don't you dare!!
28517|0x00280B53|Don't you dare!!
28518|0x00280B73|The album was confiscated before I got the chance to see the photo.
28519|0x00280BC1|The album was confiscated~before I got the chance to see~the photo.
28520|0x00280C49|Guess we'll have to settle for some secret stories from her childhood~then.
28521|0x00280C9F|Guess we'll have to settle for~some secret stories from her~childhood then.
28522|0x00280D14|From which age would you like to hear about, Kogasaka-san?
28523|0x00280D59|From which age would you like~to hear about, Kogasaka-san?
28524|0x00280DBD|...Seems like you two are intent on keeping me here at all costs.
28525|0x00280E09|...Seems like you two are~intent on keeping me here at~all costs.
28526|0x00280E5A|Quite the lively family.
28527|0x00280E7D|Quite the lively family.
28528|0x00280EF0|After enjoying one cup of tea, I left their house.
28529|0x00280F2D|After enjoying one cup of tea,~I left their house.
28530|0x00280F6F|Asuho was waiting for me, so I couldn't stay for too long.
28531|0x00280FB4|Asuho was waiting for me, so I~couldn't stay for too long.
28532|0x0028102F|Kogasaka-kun, you wouldn't happen to know a Kogasaka Shino, would you?
28533|0x00281080|Kogasaka-kun, you wouldn't~happen to know a Kogasaka~Shino, would you?
28534|0x002810D6|Mayaka-san, who volunteered to walk me to the station, suddenly asked~me that.
28535|0x0028112F|Mayaka-san, who volunteered to~walk me to the station,~suddenly asked me that.
28536|0x00281197|...Shino-san? Yeah, I know her.
28537|0x002811C1|...Shino-san? Yeah, I know her.
28538|0x0028120A|Thought so.
28539|0x00281220|Thought so.
28540|0x00281245|Well, she's my aunt and all...
28541|0x0028126E|Well, she's my aunt and all...
28542|0x002812B6|Makes sense. I never heard anything about her getting married, after~all. When you told me your name, the possibility did flash through my~mind, though.
28543|0x00281359|Makes sense. I never heard~anything about her getting~married, after all. When you~told me your name, the
28544|0x002813D2|And now it was me who had a thought.
28545|0x00281401|And now it was me who had a~thought.
28546|0x0028143F|Did Shino go to Hibari High, too?
28547|0x0028146B|Did Shino go to Hibari High,~too?
28548|0x0028149C|Actually, when I searched through Hibari High's yearbooks, I did spot~a student with the same name.
28549|0x0028150A|Actually, when I searched~through Hibari High's~yearbooks, I did spot a student~with the same name.
28550|0x00281597|Yep. I guess she never told you.
28551|0x002815C2|Yep. I guess she never told~you.
28552|0x002815F2|Shino-san never really brought it up, and I never thought of asking~her about it.
28553|0x0028164E|Shino-san never really brought~it up, and I never thought of~asking her about it.
28554|0x002816AF|However, with a little bit of thought, it did make sense.
28555|0x002816F3|However, with a little bit of~thought, it did make sense.
28556|0x0028173C|After all, Hibari High is where my mom had gone to school.
28557|0x00281781|After all, Hibari High is where~my mom had gone to school.
28558|0x002817D5|So does that mean you were classmates with her?
28559|0x0028180F|So does that mean you were~classmates with her?
28560|0x00281868|Not quite. Shino's two years younger than me, which put us in~different grade levels, so naturally we never wound up in the same~class.
28561|0x002818FA|Not quite. Shino's two years~younger than me, which put us~in different grade levels, so~naturally we never wound up in

28568|0x00281B58|Asuho's dad told me I could call it a day when evening came, but since~I couldn't help during the lunch rush, I would've felt bad if I didn't~help out during the evening rush.

28592|0x0028238C|Although Aoi-san had joined the Astro Club, that didn't mean her~attitude towards me had softened.

28848|0x00286E4C|She would?
28849|0x00286E61|She would?

28859|0x002871B0|It looks like you won't be~going to the lookout as part of~club activities.
28860|0x00287215|Ah, yeah. Would you rather we not go?
28861|0x00287245|Ah, yeah. Would you rather we~not go?

28926|0x002886D4|I don't know any of the details surrounding it, like what kind of~accident it was, but that was the reason they built that fence there~in the first place.

28929|0x00288842|I definitely won't let an~accident happen.
28930|0x00288896|I can't come along because I've got work left to do, but should~something happen, make it all my responsibility. That's my condition.
28931|0x00288926|I can't come along because I've~got work left to do, but should~something happen, make it all~my responsibility. That's my
28932|0x002889B0|...That was a very heavy condition.

28934|0x00288A2B|Can you promise me that?
28935|0x00288A4E|Can you promise me that?
28936|0x00288A80|I can.
28937|0x00288A91|I can.

28941|0x00288B57|...I agree that the stars look~really beautiful there.
28942|0x00288BA7|Ah, so then...
28943|0x00288BC0|Ah, so then...
28944|0x00288BF8|Actually, I've heard there's growing opposition to the lookout being~closed off. It could even be a destination for tourists, if it was~open.
28945|0x00288C90|Actually, I've heard there's~growing opposition to the~lookout being closed off. It~could even be a destination for
28946|0x00288D2D|That's why I would have wanted you to wait until it's open to the~public again and properly serviced.
28947|0x00288D9D|That's why I would have wanted~you to wait until it's open to~the public again and properly~serviced.
28948|0x00288E12|Shino-san then stood up.
28949|0x00288E35|Shino-san then stood up.
28950|0x00288E77|I'm sure your mother would've objected. But as a former Astronomy Club~member myself, well...
28951|0x00288EDF|I'm sure your mother would've~objected. But as a former~Astronomy Club member myself,~well...
28952|0x00288F66|I can't say no to a few kids that just want to look at Hibarigasaki's~starry night.

28957|0x0028914F|...I only wanted to go see~Mare, but now it's like this~place is a big deal, huh?
28958|0x002891BA|That's only natural.
28959|0x002891D9|That's only natural.
28960|0x00289217|Isn't it weird that they ever closed it off in the first place?
28961|0x00289261|Isn't it weird that they ever~closed it off in the first~place?
28962|0x002892BA|Maybe it's a difference in perception, or maybe adults just look at it~differently than we do.
28963|0x00289323|Maybe it's a difference in~perception, or maybe adults~just look at it differently~than we do.
28964|0x00289391|No matter how safe it was, there was some part of me that felt~hesitation about bringing Suzuha-chan along.
28965|0x00289407|No matter how safe it was,~there was some part of me that~felt hesitation about bringing~Suzuha-chan along.

28982|0x00289842|Aoi-san, of course, was decidedly unhappy.
28983|0x00289877|Aoi-san, of course, was~decidedly unhappy.

28990|0x00289B0D|Oh you're gonna do some stargazing while we're there?
28991|0x00289B4D|Oh you're gonna do some~stargazing while we're there?
28992|0x00289BAC|I don't know, but just in case.
28993|0x00289BD6|I don't know, but just in case.
28994|0x00289C1F|I'll be super happy if you let me use it too!

28996|0x00289CAE|Not in a million years.
28997|0x00289CD0|Not in a million years.
28998|0x00289D26|Aoi-san wandered over to her house.
28999|0x00289D54|Aoi-san wandered over to her~house.
29000|0x00289D87|Her parents didn't seem to be home, since there were no lights on in~the house.
29001|0x00289DE1|Her parents didn't seem to be~home, since there were no~lights on in the house.
29002|0x00289E7F|Onee-chan doesn't let me use her telescope either. It seems really~really important to her.
29003|0x00289EE5|Onee-chan doesn't let me use~her telescope either. It seems~really really important to her.

29012|0x0028A15C|That's none of your business.

29014|0x0028A1D6|But why? Why?! We're family now!
29015|0x0028A201|But why? Why?! We're family~now!
29016|0x0028A24B|Shut up, circus clown.

29026|0x0028A503|Why do you have it?
29027|0x0028A521|Why do you have it?
29028|0x0028A55E|I just said you may not ask me about it.
29029|0x0028A591|I just said you may not ask me~about it.
29030|0x0028A5D3|Want me to carry the telescope for you?

29034|0x0028A68D|You know, Asuho said she'd buy you a carrying case for your telescope.
29035|0x0028A6DE|You know, Asuho said she'd buy~you a carrying case for your~telescope.
29036|0x0028A74E|Don't bother.
29037|0x0028A766|Don't bother.
29038|0x0028A78D|She'd buy it with our club funds, so no reason to feel shy.
29039|0x0028A7D3|She'd buy it with our club~funds, so no reason to feel~shy.
29040|0x0028A81E|Although, those funds weren't coming until the second semester.
29041|0x0028A868|Although, those funds weren't~coming until the second~semester.
29042|0x0028A8D1|Still, just tell her not to bother.
29043|0x0028A8FF|Still, just tell her not to~bother.
29044|0x0028A93C|Well, you're already an Astro Club member, right?
29045|0x0028A978|Well, you're already an Astro~Club member, right?
29046|0x0028A9D3|That has nothing to do with it.
29047|0x0028A9FD|That has nothing to do with it.
29048|0x0028AA2C|Actually, it did have something to do with it.
29049|0x0028AA65|Actually, it did have something~to do with it.
29050|0x0028AABD|More importantly, if we're really doing this, then let's not waste~time.
29051|0x0028AB10|More importantly, if we're~really doing this, then let's~not waste time.
29052|0x0028AB74|If it gets too late, our parents will come home and find us nowhere to~be seen. I wouldn't be surprised if they then reported us as missing~or something.
29053|0x0028AC18|If it gets too late, our~parents will come home and find~us nowhere to be seen. I~wouldn't be surprised if they
29054|0x0028ACCE|Mom and Dad are worrywarts, after all...
29055|0x0028AD01|Mom and Dad are worrywarts,~after all...
29056|0x0028AD53|Considering that, the fact that they're so self-centered doesn't~really sit well with me.
29057|0x0028ADB7|Considering that, the fact that~they're so self-centered~doesn't really sit well with~me.
29058|0x0028AE20|I guess that's why Aoi-san was so used to taking care of and looking~after Suzuha-chan.
29059|0x0028AE82|I guess that's why Aoi-san was~so used to taking care of and~looking after Suzuha-chan.

30067|0x0029D344|...And you're all down in the~dumps again. Seriously, if you~constantly act like that,~people will get the impression
30068|0x0029D3D5|Y'know, it's like you're acting all high and mighty and you don't even~want to hang out with us.
30069|0x0029D440|Y'know, it's like you're acting~all high and mighty and you~don't even want to hang out~with us.
30070|0x0029D4BA|No, I mean, that's not really what I'm thinking honestly.
30071|0x0029D4FE|No, I mean, that's not really~what I'm thinking honestly.
30072|0x0029D561|You sure aren't convincing me.
30073|0x0029D58A|You sure aren't convincing me.
30074|0x0029D5C2|I'm okay with the remedial classes. I'd cry if it was just me by~myself, but it does help that I've got a friend with me.
30075|0x0029D646|I'm okay with the remedial~classes. I'd cry if it was just~me by myself, but it does help~that I've got a friend with me.
30076|0x0029D6E9|Yeah, of course, the class dunce Asuho would be there with you. No~need to remind me of that!
30077|0x0029D751|Yeah, of course, the class~dunce Asuho would be there with~you. No need to remind me of~that!
30078|0x0029D7C8|Well, it works out in my favor, so no complaints by me.
30079|0x0029D80A|Well, it works out in my favor,~so no complaints by me.
30080|0x0029D86B|What the heck is that for?!
30081|0x0029D891|What the heck is that for?!
30082|0x0029D8C6|If I've got you there with me, unpleasant things become not so~unpleasant.
30083|0x0029D91B|If I've got you there with me,~unpleasant things become not so~unpleasant.
30084|0x0029D975|She is a great mood maker after all.
30085|0x0029D9A4|She is a great mood maker after~all.
30086|0x0029D9E6|I don't know how she interpreted my words, but she got really red in~the face.
30087|0x0029DA3F|I don't know how she~interpreted my words, but she~got really red in the face.
30088|0x0029DAA7|Besides, I'm not feeling depressed or anything. I'm just thinking~about something.
30089|0x0029DB04|Besides, I'm not feeling~depressed or anything. I'm just~thinking about something.
30090|0x0029DB80|L-Like what exactly?
30091|0x0029DB9F|L-Like what exactly?
30092|0x0029DBCD|How to persuade Hisakaki.
30093|0x0029DBF1|How to persuade Hisakaki.
30094|0x0029DC34|Grr.
30095|0x0029DC43|Grr.
30096|0x0029DC57|That's all it took to put her in a bad mood.
30097|0x0029DC8E|That's all it took to put her~in a bad mood.
30098|0x0029DCCA|I never get tired of watching her vivid facial expressions, which~change just as quickly as Chinami's, albeit in different ways. It's~like she can brighten the whole room with a smile.
30099|0x0029DD8D|I never get tired of watching~her vivid facial expressions,~which change just as quickly as~Chinami's, albeit in different
30100|0x0029DE21|Yeah, see, I met Hisakaki yesterday and we talked for a bit. Long~story short, I asked her to give us permission to use the rooftop.
30101|0x0029DEB0|Yeah, see, I met Hisakaki~yesterday and we talked for a~bit. Long story short, I asked~her to give us permission to
30102|0x0029DF4D|And she said no?
30103|0x0029DF68|And she said no?
30104|0x0029DF92|Yeah, but I didn't think it would be that easy to change her mind.
30105|0x0029DFDF|Yeah, but I didn't think it~would be that easy to change~her mind.
30106|0x0029E04B|Can't disagree there. It's Komomo-chan we're talking about, after all.
30107|0x0029E09C|Can't disagree there. It's~Komomo-chan we're talking~about, after all.
30108|0x0029E0FC|Well, above all else she is diligent, so if I keep earnestly asking~her, I think I should get results.
30109|0x0029E16D|Well, above all else she is~diligent, so if I keep~earnestly asking her, I think I~should get results.
30110|0x0029E1FD|You really think so?
30111|0x0029E21C|You really think so?
30112|0x0029E24A|Yeah.
30113|0x0029E25A|Yeah.
30114|0x0029E289|How can you be so sure?
30115|0x0029E2AB|How can you be so sure?
30116|0x0029E2DC|It's obvious if you just look at her.
30117|0x0029E30C|It's obvious if you just look~at her.
30118|0x0029E35B|Grr.
30119|0x0029E36A|Grr.
30120|0x0029E388|But it's surprisingly difficult to keep stubbornly asking her.
30121|0x0029E3D1|But it's surprisingly difficult~to keep stubbornly asking her.
30122|0x0029E439|Well, with summer break, you've hardly got any chances to see her.
30123|0x0029E486|Well, with summer break, you've~hardly got any chances to see~her.
30124|0x0029E4E2|Yeah, and I kinda feel uncomfortable visiting her place directly, too.
30125|0x0029E533|Yeah, and I kinda feel~uncomfortable visiting her~place directly, too.
30126|0x0029E589|Hisakaki likely had her own plans, too, so I didn't want to bother~her.
30127|0x0029E5DB|Hisakaki likely had her own~plans, too, so I didn't want to~bother her.
30128|0x0029E64C|Can't you just call her?
30129|0x0029E66F|Can't you just call her?
30130|0x0029E6A1|Well, I don't have her number, and Kosame-san won't tell me either.
30131|0x0029E6EF|Well, I don't have her number,~and Kosame-san won't tell me~either.
30132|0x0029E75C|She probably told her specifically not to give it out to anyone, would~be my guess. And Kosame-chan being on Komomo-chan's side and all,~she'll obey her word.
30133|0x0029E805|She probably told her~specifically not to give it out~to anyone, would be my guess.~And Kosame-chan being on
30134|0x0029E88B|I suppose there's always the chance Kosame-san might pull through and~convince her, but still, I have to do things from my end as well.
30135|0x0029E91D|I suppose there's always the~chance Kosame-san might pull~through and convince her, but~still, I have to do things from
30136|0x0029E9BE|Won't you be able to see her on Attendance Day?
30137|0x0029E9F8|Won't you be able to see her on~Attendance Day?
30138|0x0029EA41|I'd kinda like to speak with her before then, honestly.
30139|0x0029EA83|I'd kinda like to speak with~her before then, honestly.
30140|0x0029EACA|I wanted the Student Council to use that day's meeting to determine~whether we could get official permission to use the rooftop, so I~needed to convince Hisakaki before that.
30141|0x0029EB83|I wanted the Student Council to~use that day's meeting to~determine whether we could get~official permission to use the
30142|0x0029EC24|Oh, come to think of it, you actually know where Kosame-chan and~Komomo-chan live, huh?
30143|0x0029EC86|Oh, come to think of it, you~actually know where Kosame-chan~and Komomo-chan live, huh?
30144|0x0029ECF7|Yeah. I was pretty surprised when I saw their home was a shrine.
30145|0x0029ED42|Yeah. I was pretty surprised~when I saw their home was a~shrine.
30146|0x0029ED9E|You went there?
30147|0x0029EDB8|You went there?
30148|0x0029EDE1|Yeah, I met their mother by chance, and then things just happened and~I ended up at their place.
30149|0x0029EE4C|Yeah, I met their mother by~chance, and then things just~happened and I ended up at~their place.
30150|0x0029EED6|Oh, you met Mayaka-san, huh? She's such a hearty person. I heard she~was apparently in a female gang in her younger days.
30151|0x0029EF5A|Oh, you met Mayaka-san, huh?~She's such a hearty person. I~heard she was apparently in a~female gang in her younger
30152|0x0029EFDD|(Oh wow, she used to be a delinquent?)
30153|0x0029F00E|(Oh wow, she used to be a~delinquent?)
30154|0x0029F04E|She said she was a member of the Astronomy Club at Hibari High.
30155|0x0029F098|She said she was a member of~the Astronomy Club at Hibari~High.
30156|0x0029F101|Oh, really?
30157|0x0029F117|Oh, really?
30158|0x0029F13C|Apparently, yeah. When we started talking about the Astro Club, she~mentioned how that took her back to her high school days.
30159|0x0029F1C4|Apparently, yeah. When we~started talking about the Astro~Club, she mentioned how that~took her back to her high
30160|0x0029F25E|Wow, that's pretty interesting. I'm curious about what the Astronomy~Club was like back then, so there's a whole bunch of stuff I'd love to~ask her.
30161|0x0029F2FD|Wow, that's pretty interesting.~I'm curious about what the~Astronomy Club was like back~then, so there's a whole bunch
30162|0x0029F38D|You'll probably get the chance to during the summer festival coming up~here.
30163|0x0029F3E4|You'll probably get the chance~to during the summer festival~coming up here.
30164|0x0029F45A|True. The venue for the festival is their shrine, after all. Man, I'm~super stoked for this year's festival, let me tell you!
30165|0x0029F4E2|True. The venue for the~festival is their shrine, after~all. Man, I'm super stoked for~this year's festival, let me
30166|0x0029F56F|What date is it exactly?
30167|0x0029F592|What date is it exactly?
30168|0x0029F5D4|Umm, it starts the Saturday of next week, so that's...
30169|0x0029F615|Umm, it starts the Saturday of~next week, so that's...
30170|0x0029F665|August 4th?
30171|0x0029F67B|August 4th?
30172|0x0029F6B0|Yep, that's it. They always hold it over the course of four days, from~the 4th to the 7th.
30173|0x0029F715|Yep, that's it. They always~hold it over the course of four~days, from the 4th to the 7th.
30174|0x0029F789|I guess that means I'll also be able to see Hisakaki on those days~when visiting the festival.
30175|0x0029F7F2|I guess that means I'll also be~able to see Hisakaki on those~days when visiting the~festival.
30176|0x0029F860|It was perfect timing for me, since it was before Attendance Day.
30177|0x0029F8AC|It was perfect timing for me,~since it was before Attendance~Day.
30178|0x0029F917|Well, you'll probably see her some, but I doubt she'll have much time~to talk and all that. Chances are she'll have her hands full with~work.
30179|0x0029F9AF|Well, you'll probably see her~some, but I doubt she'll have~much time to talk and all that.~Chances are she'll have her
30180|0x0029FA36|Oh, true. After all, she's a shrine maiden.
30181|0x0029FA6C|Oh, true. After all, she's a~shrine maiden.
30182|0x0029FAC1|You-chan, are you thinking about something weird?
30183|0x0029FAFD|You-chan, are you thinking~about something weird?
30184|0x0029FB48|Nope, not at all.
30185|0x0029FB64|Nope, not at all.
30186|0x0029FB9F|Smells fishy to me.
30187|0x0029FBBD|Smells fishy to me.
30188|0x0029FBEA|I was just wondering whether the shrine might be looking for some~extra help for the festival. You know, like a part-time job.
30189|0x0029FC73|I was just wondering whether~the shrine might be looking for~some extra help for the~festival. You know, like a
30190|0x0029FCF2|That would give me more chances to talk to her. Managing the stalls~isn't their responsibility apparently, but surely there's something~else I could do.
30191|0x0029FD95|That would give me more chances~to talk to her. Managing the~stalls isn't their~responsibility apparently, but
30192|0x0029FE2D|Ah, I knew it! If you do that, then we won't be able to go check out~the festival together! It's already bad enough that Kosame-chan won't~be there with us!
30193|0x0029FED4|Ah, I knew it! If you do that,~then we won't be able to go~check out the festival~together! It's already bad
30194|0x0029FF5A|Oh, is Kosame-san a shrine maiden, too?
30195|0x0029FF8C|Oh, is Kosame-san a shrine~maiden, too?
30196|0x0029FFDD|Yes, she is!
30197|0x0029FFF4|Yes, she is!
30198|0x002A0010|Well, they are sisters so that's only natural.
30199|0x002A0049|Well, they are sisters so~that's only natural.
30200|0x002A00A1|It's a shame about Kosame-chan, but we'll just have to go around the~festival together with the whole Astro Club to make up for it.
30201|0x002A012F|It's a shame about Kosame-chan,~but we'll just have to go~around the festival together~with the whole Astro Club to
30202|0x002A01B2|Guess I'll have to abide by our vice president's directive.
30203|0x002A01F8|Guess I'll have to abide by our~vice president's directive.
30204|0x002A025D|We still haven't properly introduced Aoi-san to everyone, so I want to~get the whole group together at least once.
30205|0x002A02DA|We still haven't properly~introduced Aoi-san to everyone,~so I want to get the whole~group together at least once.
30206|0x002A035C|During the day of the closing ceremony on which we were unofficially~acknowledged as a club, we did create a chat group, but Aoi-san~herself wasn't present in the club room.
30207|0x002A0414|During the day of the closing~ceremony on which we were~unofficially acknowledged as a~club, we did create a chat
30208|0x002A0495|Chinami gave us her number in her absence.
30209|0x002A04CA|Chinami gave us her number in~her absence.
30210|0x002A051E|Once the festival is over, I'm thinking we could have an after party~at our cafe so we can add Kosame-chan in the mix as well.
30211|0x002A05A7|Once the festival is over, I'm~thinking we could have an after~party at our cafe so we can add~Kosame-chan in the mix as well.
30212|0x002A0635|Seeing how happy Asuho was to talk about it, I naturally nodded along.
30213|0x002A0686|Seeing how happy Asuho was to~talk about it, I naturally~nodded along.
30214|0x002A075E|Hello, Kogasaka-san.
30215|0x002A077D|Hello, Kogasaka-san.
30216|0x002A07A1|During work at the Milky Way later that day, Kosame-san suddenly~walked through the door.
30217|0x002A0805|During work at the Milky Way~later that day, Kosame-san~suddenly walked through the~door.
30218|0x002A087E|Welcome to the Milky Way. Is it just you today?
30219|0x002A08B8|Welcome to the Milky Way. Is it~just you today?
30220|0x002A0911|Yes. I invited Nee-san to join me, but unfortunately, she declined to~come.
30221|0x002A0967|Yes. I invited Nee-san to join~me, but unfortunately, she~declined to come.
30222|0x002A09DE|I showed Kosame-san to a table, and Asuho immediately brought her a~glass of water.
30223|0x002A0A3C|I showed Kosame-san to a table,~and Asuho immediately brought~her a glass of water.
30224|0x002A0AD5|It's been forever, Kosame-chan!
30225|0x002A0AFF|It's been forever, Kosame-chan!
30226|0x002A0B63|Two days is a bit short for forever.
30227|0x002A0B92|Two days is a bit short for~forever.
30228|0x002A0BE0|Have you decided on your order yet?
30229|0x002A0C0E|Have you decided on your order~yet?
30230|0x002A0C5B|I'd like what I usually get, please.
30231|0x002A0C8A|I'd like what I usually get,~please.
30232|0x002A0CD8|A Cross of Calvary it is. We'll have that right out to you!
30233|0x002A0D1E|A Cross of Calvary it is. We'll~have that right out to you!
30234|0x002A0D7C|Having taken the order, Asuho then disappeared into the kitchen.
30235|0x002A0DC7|Having taken the order, Asuho~then disappeared into the~kitchen.
30236|0x002A0E45|To tell you the truth, I'm secretly collecting the crosses.
30237|0x002A0E8B|To tell you the truth, I'm~secretly collecting the~crosses.
30238|0x002A0ED6|Sort of like how kids collect the flags they get in their kids' meals.
30239|0x002A0F27|Sort of like how kids collect~the flags they get in their~kids' meals.
30240|0x002A0F87|Typical for a girl.
30241|0x002A0FA5|Typical for a girl.
30242|0x002A0FE2|I suppose you'd like me to label you as a sexist, then.
30243|0x002A1024|I suppose you'd like me to~label you as a sexist, then.
30244|0x002A1075|No, uh, please don't do that.
30245|0x002A109D|No, uh, please don't do that.
30246|0x002A10E4|Of course, I wouldn't think of it. I know what kind of a person you~are.
30247|0x002A1137|Of course, I wouldn't think of~it. I know what kind of a~person you are.
30248|0x002A118F|Asuho and her dad were handling the cooking by themselves, and there~wasn't any other work to do. Normally I just do the dishes, wipe the~tables, and organize the chairs.
30249|0x002A1244|Asuho and her dad were handling~the cooking by themselves, and~there wasn't any other work to~do. Normally I just do the

30251|0x002A1376|Would you care to take a seat~and join me? Just like last~time, I've come here because~there's something I need to
30252|0x002A1402|All right, just for a little bit then.
30253|0x002A1433|All right, just for a little~bit then.
30254|0x002A1469|While Asuho is in the kitchen, I'm in charge of waiting on the~customers. So, my only job now was to keep Kosame-san company until~other customers appeared.

30257|0x002A1607|Kogasaka-kun, do you happen to~have any plans for this coming~weekend?
30258|0x002A1667|Not that I can think of. Remedial classes end on Friday, and work is~practically speaking only on weekdays.

30260|0x002A1772|Would you like to go to the beach with us then?
30261|0x002A17AC|Would you like to go to the~beach with us then?
30262|0x002A17EB|A very sudden offer.
30263|0x002A180A|A very sudden offer.
30264|0x002A1848|You see, the thing is, apparently our mother wants to see Shino-san~and catch up. They haven't seen each other in quite some time,~actually.
30265|0x002A18DF|You see, the thing is,~apparently our mother wants to~see Shino-san and catch up.~They haven't seen each other in
30266|0x002A1960|I see, that's fair.
30267|0x002A197E|I see, that's fair.
30268|0x002A19AB|Makes sense. She said they were both in the Astronomy Club, after all.
30269|0x002A19FC|Makes sense. She said they were~both in the Astronomy Club,~after all.
30270|0x002A1A6C|Yes. So would you think about coming to relax at Hibarigasaki's beach~together with Shino-san? Chinami-san is welcome too.
30271|0x002A1AF1|Yes. So would you think about~coming to relax at~Hibarigasaki's beach together~with Shino-san? Chinami-san is
30272|0x002A1B78|Okay, I'll ask them about it.
30273|0x002A1BA0|Okay, I'll ask them about it.
30274|0x002A1BE7|While you're at it, it would also be nice if you could ask her which~day works best for her, Saturday or Sunday.

31918|0x002C3BC6|Chinami-chan is just as cute and nice in her own way. I mean, she is~teaching Suzuha-chan how to swim and all. I woulda loved to have a~little sister like her as well.

31924|0x002C3E6B|Hmm?

31926|0x002C3EA8|It's a rubber boat. Just wait a bit while I inflate it.
31927|0x002C3EEA|It's a rubber boat. Just wait a~bit while I inflate it.

31932|0x002C4172|But, err, getting into the boat as a guy while having a girl push you~out is sort of, yeah...

31942|0x002C4485|We'd gotten to pretty deep parts by now, since Asuho had shifted to~swimming from walking, pushing the boat forward with flutter kicks.

31964|0x002C4AA6|Ahaha. You can't swim?

31976|0x002C4DD8|It sure is quiet...

31978|0x002C4E19|The water's surface glittered with a silver color, as if it was~covered with gems.
31979|0x002C4E76|The water's surface glittered~with a silver color, as if it~was covered with gems.

31984|0x002C5022|It's really no wonder, but I think I've gotten tired now...

31986|0x002C50BD|Wanna change places?

31988|0x002C5100|Asuho shook her head.

31990|0x002C5151|...Can I get on?
31991|0x002C516C|...Can I get on?
31992|0x002C5196|So you do wanna change places.
31993|0x002C51BF|So you do wanna change places.
31994|0x002C51F9|Can I get on with you?
31995|0x002C521A|Can I get on with you?
31996|0x002C5240|(Wait, wasn't this boat just for one person?)

31998|0x002C52BB|Before I even had the chance to ask that question, Asuho hopped onto~the boat.

32000|0x002C5395|I expected her to sit on the other side with her back to me.
32001|0x002C53DC|I expected her to sit on the~other side with her back to me.
32002|0x002C5428|But her back was right in front of me.
32003|0x002C5459|But her back was right in front~of me.
32004|0x002C548F|Her body was between my legs.
32005|0x002C54B7|Her body was between my legs.
32006|0x002C54E4|Since the boat was so tiny, this position made it to where I could~embrace her by merely wrapping my arms around in front of me.

32014|0x002C56B7|I couldn't see her face.
32015|0x002C56DA|I couldn't see her face.
32016|0x002C5702|So, I had no idea what Asuho was thinking.
32017|0x002C5737|So, I had no idea what Asuho~was thinking.
32018|0x002C5771|The boat rocked a bit.
32019|0x002C5792|The boat rocked a bit.
32020|0x002C57B8|Because the mass was unevenly slanted towards one side, the boat~swayed unsteadily in the waves.

32022|0x002C5893|And every time that happened, our bodies came into contact.
32023|0x002C58D9|And every time that happened,~our bodies came into contact.
32024|0x002C5924|Since we were both in swimwear, not much of our skin was covered by~clothing, which resulted in my bare chest touching her bare back.

32034|0x002C5B69|My heart was so noisy that it blocked out every other sound.

32038|0x002C5C50|In this world where I could hear nothing but the throbbing of my~heart, Asuho's voice alone reached my ears perfectly.

32048|0x002C5F1D|Just getting on a boat like this together with a guy...
32049|0x002C5F5F|Just getting on a boat like~this together with a guy...
32050|0x002C5FA6|She went to a guy's house to pick him up, but it was too early for her~to step into the house.

32053|0x002C60DA|So, she skipped over that and~instead got on an inflatable~boat together with him.
32054|0x002C613C|So far, the guy in all those scenarios has been me.

32057|0x002C6214|My heart is beating so fast...
32058|0x002C6242|By steps, maybe she was talking about how much each of those actions~made her heart race.

32060|0x002C631B|I-If you don't like it, just say so... I'll get off at once...

32072|0x002C65C8|An unusually big wave arrived.

32088|0x002C68E5|I clung for dear life.
32089|0x002C6906|I clung for dear life.

32094|0x002C6AD4|...Ah.

32100|0x002C6BB1|If it were Hisakaki, she would have gone into a raging fit, and with~Aoi-san, I bet she'd tell me to go die. I'm positive Mare would have~reaped me with her scythe.

32106|0x002C6DD2|It's... okay...

32112|0x002C6EA9|That made no sense.

32118|0x002C7018|The wave had already gone past us.

32120|0x002C7077|Yet this soft, warm sensation was still in my arms, which rendered me~unable to do anything at all. I prayed for another wave to come and~flip over the boat, just to escape this situation.

32616|0x002D0A72|Once there, I could then finish my work promptly. I would've needed~nothing more.
32617|0x002D0ACE|Once there, I could then finish~my work promptly. I would've~needed nothing more.
32618|0x002D0B49|But Mom didn't allow that.
32619|0x002D0B6E|But Mom didn't allow that.
32620|0x002D0BB2|A fine nuisance, I'll say.
32621|0x002D0BD7|A fine nuisance, I'll say.
32622|0x002D0C1B|I'm actually grateful to her for that.
32623|0x002D0C4C|I'm actually grateful to her~for that.
32624|0x002D0C9C|Why is that?
32625|0x002D0CB3|Why is that?
32626|0x002D0CE9|Because had she not, I would never have gotten to know you.
32627|0x002D0D2F|Because had she not, I would~never have gotten to know you.
32628|0x002D0D94|I'm glad I was able to become friends with you, is what I'm saying.
32629|0x002D0DE2|I'm glad I was able to become~friends with you, is what I'm~saying.
32630|0x002D0E4F|...Is that also the reason you coerced me into joining the Astro Club?

32632|0x002D0F10|Yes.

32634|0x002D0F4D|Honestly, a fine nuisance, you lot.

32636|0x002D0FBA|I won't deny it.
32637|0x002D0FD5|I won't deny it.
32638|0x002D100F|...So what did you summon me for?
32639|0x002D103B|...So what did you summon me~for?
32640|0x002D1086|Just to see how you were doing.
32641|0x002D10B0|Just to see how you were doing.
32642|0x002D10EB|That can hardly be the only reason.
32643|0x002D1119|That can hardly be the only~reason.
32644|0x002D1166|Of course. I think you are already aware of it too, but the number of~people visiting the lookout has grown numerous lately.

32646|0x002D128B|That seems to be the case, yes. A quite troubling development.

32648|0x002D133C|Do you happen to know the reason behind it?

32650|0x002D13C7|Nothing beyond that it has something to do with Kogasaka You.
32651|0x002D140F|Nothing beyond that it has~something to do with Kogasaka~You.
32652|0x002D1476|They're all going there to stargaze, with him acting as the leader.

32655|0x002D1542|......
32656|0x002D1572|In and of itself, that doesn't pose much of a problem. Once our Astro~Club starts doing things for real, everyone should change over to the~rooftop for stargazing.

32660|0x002D173E|Which would be?
32661|0x002D1758|Which would be?
32662|0x002D1791|Apparently, a shinigami shows up here.
32663|0x002D17C2|Apparently, a shinigami shows~up here.
32664|0x002D1812|...A shinigami, you say?
32665|0x002D1835|...A shinigami, you say?
32666|0x002D1877|Yes. A girl who carries a massive scythe with her.
32667|0x002D18B4|Yes. A girl who carries a~massive scythe with her.
32668|0x002D1902|It seems that Kogasaka-san is visiting the lookout to see her.
32669|0x002D194B|It seems that Kogasaka-san is~visiting the lookout to see~her.
32670|0x002D19B3|So, it's very possible that Kogasaka-san will continue going there~even when we shift to the rooftop.

32674|0x002D1B7F|I can't say.
32675|0x002D1B96|I can't say.

32682|0x002D1DBF|Yes. During our beach trip, albeit only for a short while, I did see~her.
32683|0x002D1E13|Yes. During our beach trip,~albeit only for a short while,~I did see her.
32684|0x002D1E86|So, it isn't limited to the lookout.

32686|0x002D1F03|......
32687|0x002D1F14|......

32694|0x002D214B|Right.
32695|0x002D215C|Right.
32696|0x002D218C|I guess I'll investigate it some on my end as well.

32698|0x002D2227|I'm happy I could be of help.

32700|0x002D2296|What makes you feel something like that towards me?

32702|0x002D2331|Don't make me repeat myself over and over again. It's because I~consider you my friend.

32710|0x002D25E1|Quite.
32711|0x002D25F2|Quite.
32712|0x002D2614|Thanks to that, it's awfully difficult for me to do my job.

32738|0x002D2E97|I did this for you, just for your information. How was I supposed to~know you didn't just forget all about it?

32744|0x002D30C3|I dropped by Asuho's cafe.

32746|0x002D3129|Why?
32747|0x002D3138|Why?
32748|0x002D3156|I negotiated my work hours so I could start around evening time until~our deal's over.

32750|0x002D321D|Persuading Asuho proved a herculean task. And the fact that the person~I was helping was Hisakaki made it all the worse.
32751|0x002D32A0|Persuading Asuho proved a~herculean task. And the fact~that the person I was helping~was Hisakaki made it all the
32752|0x002D332D|...You're going there around evening to work?
32753|0x002D3365|...You're going there around~evening to work?
32754|0x002D33AC|Yeah. I'll get the sweeping and water sprinkling done by then, though,~I promise.
32755|0x002D3408|Yeah. I'll get the sweeping and~water sprinkling done by then,~though, I promise.
32756|0x002D3475|What a shame. I'd actually thought of some other work for you to do~after that.
32757|0x002D34CF|What a shame. I'd actually~thought of some other work for~you to do after that.
32758|0x002D352E|...Good thing I arranged my work hours in advance.
32759|0x002D356B|...Good thing I arranged my~work hours in advance.
32760|0x002D35C4|Well, I guess I can just make you come in everyday to make up for it.
32761|0x002D3614|Well, I guess I can just make~you come in everyday to make up~for it.
32762|0x002D3673|What?! I have to come tomorrow, too?!
32763|0x002D36A3|What?! I have to come tomorrow,~too?!
32764|0x002D36EF|Of course you do.
32765|0x002D370B|Of course you do.
32766|0x002D3736|I only have to do your share of the work, right? Are you telling me~it's your turn again tomorrow?
32767|0x002D37A3|I only have to do your share of~the work, right? Are you~telling me it's your turn again~tomorrow?
32768|0x002D3821|Nope, it's Kosame's.
32769|0x002D3840|Nope, it's Kosame's.
32770|0x002D386E|Then how's that my problem!
32771|0x002D3894|Then how's that my problem!
32772|0x002D38CB|My second demand is for you to also help out with Kosame's work. She~has her hands full with summer festival prep work.
32773|0x002D394D|My second demand is for you to~also help out with Kosame's~work. She has her hands full~with summer festival prep work.
32774|0x002D39EB|Well, it's basically just me and Kosame taking turns. Now you can come~help every day, Kogasaka-kun.
32775|0x002D3A5A|Well, it's basically just me~and Kosame taking turns. Now~you can come help every day,~Kogasaka-kun.
32776|0x002D3ACE|She explained it triumphantly.
32777|0x002D3AF7|She explained it triumphantly.
32778|0x002D3B2F|...Fine. A promise is a promise.
32779|0x002D3B5A|...Fine. A promise is a~promise.
32780|0x002D3B96|I see you're also quite diligent yourself, though it's more like~conscientious.
32781|0x002D3BF0|I see you're also quite~diligent yourself, though it's~more like conscientious.
32782|0x002D3C59|But while I'll help every day, it'll only be until the evenings, all~right?
32783|0x002D3CAF|But while I'll help every day,~it'll only be until the~evenings, all right?
32784|0x002D3D16|Fine by me.
32785|0x002D3D2C|Fine by me.
32786|0x002D3D51|Want me to go fill a bucket of water?
32787|0x002D3D81|Want me to go fill a bucket of~water?
32788|0x002D3DC2|If you could. I'll continue off this one.
32789|0x002D3DF6|If you could. I'll continue off~this one.
32790|0x002D3E2F|Even with me here now, she didn't try to shove everything onto me.~Deep down, she really is a nice person, I have to say.

32793|0x002D3FAE|I made a trip to the faucet and~back again. After getting more~water, my only job was to chat~with Hisakaki.
32794|0x002D4041|Do you know how hot it's supposed to get today?
32795|0x002D407B|Do you know how hot it's~supposed to get today?
32796|0x002D40C4|No, and I don't really want to know.
32797|0x002D40F3|No, and I don't really want to~know.
32798|0x002D413E|That's pretty smart. I wanna hurry up and finish so I can cool off in~the AC too.
32799|0x002D419A|That's pretty smart. I wanna~hurry up and finish so I can~cool off in the AC too.
32800|0x002D4205|Don't you have summer festival prep work once we're done with this?
32801|0x002D4253|Don't you have summer festival~prep work once we're done with~this?
32802|0x002D42B2|Unlike Kosame and our mom, I can do my part at night, and well, it's~cooler that way.
32803|0x002D4312|Unlike Kosame and our mom, I~can do my part at night, and~well, it's cooler that way.
32804|0x002D4381|But then that means you've got ample time during the day. Why do I~need to help you out?
32805|0x002D43E4|But then that means you've got~ample time during the day. Why~do I need to help you out?
32806|0x002D4458|Even if I'm free, I don't wanna go outside. A suntan's the last thing~I want.
32807|0x002D44B0|Even if I'm free, I don't wanna~go outside. A suntan's the last~thing I want.
32808|0x002D450D|Hisakaki's skin is as white as freshly-fallen snow.
32809|0x002D454B|Hisakaki's skin is as white as~freshly-fallen snow.
32810|0x002D45A5|Being a shrine maiden sure comes with a lot of hardships.
32811|0x002D45E9|Being a shrine maiden sure~comes with a lot of hardships.
32812|0x002D4632|True enough. A shrine maiden with a suntan would look pretty crude.
32813|0x002D4680|True enough. A shrine maiden~with a suntan would look pretty~crude.
32814|0x002D46DF|The primary reason I can't get a suntan is my summer festival job~though...
32815|0x002D4735|The primary reason I can't get~a suntan is my summer festival~job though...
32816|0x002D4790|She muttered grumpily.
32817|0x002D47B1|She muttered grumpily.
32818|0x002D47E1|Considering you went to the beach, your skin looks pretty good.
32819|0x002D482B|Considering you went to the~beach, your skin looks pretty~good.
32820|0x002D4891|Because I used suntan lotion.
32821|0x002D48B9|Because I used suntan lotion.
32822|0x002D48F0|I thought you were trying like hell to avoid anyone putting any on~you?
32823|0x002D4942|I thought you were trying like~hell to avoid anyone putting~any on you?
32824|0x002D49B0|...Don't stir up unpleasant memories, please. I put some on before we~got there.
32825|0x002D4A0B|...Don't stir up unpleasant~memories, please. I put some on~before we got there.
32826|0x002D4A6B|Makes sense.
32827|0x002D4A82|Makes sense.
32828|0x002D4AA8|Well, I can understand why Kosame-san would want to rub suntan lotion~on you by all means. Your skin is so fair and pretty, I mean... Hey!~Why are you splashing water on me?!
32829|0x002D4B61|Well, I can understand why~Kosame-san would want to rub~suntan lotion on you by all~means. Your skin is so fair and
32830|0x002D4BF0|Ask yourself that, giving me that dirty look.
32831|0x002D4C28|Ask yourself that, giving me~that dirty look.
32832|0x002D4C6F|Hey now, I'm not like Kosame-san.
32833|0x002D4C9B|Hey now, I'm not like~Kosame-san.
32834|0x002D4CD8|You're the one who actually shouldn't try to make her out to be as~perverted as you. I'm positive she only does those things as a joke.
32835|0x002D4D6A|You're the one who actually~shouldn't try to make her out~to be as perverted as you. I'm~positive she only does those

32837|0x002D4E2D|As do I... Hey! Don't splash~water on me!
32838|0x002D4E72|Hmph.
32839|0x002D4E82|Hmph.
32840|0x002D4E97|On that subject, though, I actually think Kosame-san is entirely~serious when she forces herself on Hisakaki.

32842|0x002D4F96|Gotta say though, Kosame-san doesn't tan at all either.
32843|0x002D4FD8|Gotta say though, Kosame-san~doesn't tan at all either.
32844|0x002D5036|She has a bodily condition where she doesn't get tanned.

33156|0x002DAAD3|I sure couldn't pinpoint anything through questioning. Though, really,~the problem's with how many versions you got floating around out~there.

33170|0x002DB0B3|Heeding that wish, the shinigami appeared and robbed the girl of all~her memories pertaining to the boy.
33171|0x002DB126|Heeding that wish, the~shinigami appeared and robbed~the girl of all her memories~pertaining to the boy.
33172|0x002DB1AA|Since it's a shinigami, I reckon you'd say it reaped the memories of~her romance with him. And, apparently, the two broke up.

34484|0x002F6478|Like, why is Setsuna-senpai even in the Astro Club to begin with?
34485|0x002F64C4|Like, why is Setsuna-senpai~even in the Astro Club to begin~with?
34486|0x002F652F|Kosame-san originally introduced her to us.
34487|0x002F6565|Kosame-san originally~introduced her to us.
34488|0x002F65BA|Apparently, Setsuna-senpai moved here from out of town. She's a~transfer student, just like you.
34489|0x002F6625|Apparently, Setsuna-senpai~moved here from out of town.~She's a transfer student, just~like you.
34490|0x002F66AF|Though she started at basically the same time we did, so I didn't~really know until I was told.

34492|0x002F67A2|So yeah, I think Kosame-chan must have invited Setsuna-senpai to join~us in consideration of the fact that she was new here.

34500|0x002F69E2|So if she moved here, does that mean they live together then?
34501|0x002F6A2A|So if she moved here, does that~mean they live together then?
34502|0x002F6A91|According to Kosame-chan, her family gave Setsuna-senpai the option of~staying at their place, but she declined and decided to live by~herself.

34506|0x002F6C5D|Last year, Setsuna-senpai showed up at the club room several times,~but she hasn't come even once this year. I guess maybe she just~doesn't have any interest in stargazing.
